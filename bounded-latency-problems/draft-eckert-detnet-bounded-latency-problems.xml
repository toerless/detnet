    <abstract>


<t>The purpose of this memo is to explain the challenges and limitations of
existing (standardized) bounded latency queuing mechanisms for desirable (large scale) 
MPLS and/or IP based networks to allow them to support DetNet services. These
challenges relate to low-cost, high-speed hardware implementations,
desirable network design approaches, system complexity, reliability, scalability,
cost of signaling, performance and jitter experience for the DetNet applications.
Many of these problems are rooted in the use of per-hop, per-flow (DetNet) forwarding and
queuing state, but highly accurate network wide time synchronization can be another
challenge for some networks.</t>

<t>This memo does not intend to propose a specific queuing solution, but in the
same way in which it describes the challenges of mechanisms, it reviews how
those problem are addressed by currently proposed new queuing mechanisms.</t>

<section anchor="summary"><name>Summary</name>

<t>The architectural evolution of IP/MPLS networks (<xref target="evolution"></xref>)  in service provider
and other "larger-than-building" (<xref target="network-types"></xref>), shared-infrastructure service networks (<xref target="shared-infra"></xref>)
has led to a range of requirements against per-hop forwarding mechanisms
which are currently not supported by the current DetNet MPLS forwarding plane <xref target="RFC8964"/>
and per-hop, per-flow queueing model<xref target="RFC8655"/>, Section 3.2, especially with respect to the
QoS support of per-hop bounded latency. The authors of this memo think that solutions for
these requirements are relatively easily added to the existing DetNet architecture by 
adding support for already existing and/or proposed, but not standardized per-hop forwarding and queuing options.</t>

<t>The following sub-sections summarize the problem, solution goals and requirements as perceived
by the authors. The reasoning for these is explained in the following sections.</t>

<t>Note that requirements are somewhat overlapping in so far as solving one of them also solves
others, but each addresses the problems from a different perspective, and are therefore easier
understood for different stakeholders. For example: Operators that do want to see support of
DetNet for example for Segment Routing (SR) would not think that this is "naturally" the same as DetNet
supporting the DiffServ architecture, even though solutions would have a hard time to support only
one of the two.</t>

<section anchor="problem-high-speed-forwarding-high-scale-fan-infan-out"><name>Problem: High speed forwarding, high scale fan-in/fan-out</name>

<t>Forwarders with bounded latency need to support interface speeds of 100 Gbps up to
Tbps, likely over a period of 10 years from initial deployment of possible DetNet solutions.
Hundreds of interfaces may need to be supported in a single forwarder (fan-in/fan-out).</t>

<t>Supporting bounded latency at these speeds and fan-in/fan-out raises cost and feasibility
challenges beyond those that had led to past IETF IntServ (GS) standards (<xref target="RFC2210"/>, <xref target="RFC2212"/>)
or more recent TSN bounded latency solutions.</t>

<t>Note that these high speed and scale requirements even cause challenges when DetNet bounded
latency traffic is intended to be used for only a small percentage of the interfaces traffic.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="solution-goal-lightweight-per-hop-per-flow-stateless-transit-hop-forwarding"><name>Solution goal: Lightweight, per-hop, per-flow stateless transit hop forwarding</name>

<t>Both high-speed hardware and network architecture design (for reasons of simplicity and minimization
of shared risk functions) do favor architectures that support a lightweight transit hop
forwarding plane design that requires no forwarding plane or control plane operations whose
scale support depends on the number of services/service-instances (e.g.: DetNet flows) offered,
but at best only on the size of the network (e.g.: no per-flow, per-hop state).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="requirement-support-for-existing-stateless-steering-solutions"><name>Requirement: Support for existing stateless / steering solutions</name>

<t>There should be DetNet bounded latency options that work in conjunction with per-transit-hop
stateless traffic forwarding such as through Shortest Path First (SPF) routing with IP/MPLS),
engineered steering (e.g.: SR) and stateless replication, such as Bit Indexed Explicit Replication with/without Tree Engineering (BIER, BIER-TE).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="requirement-pce-to-ingressegress-lsr-only-flow-signaling"><name>Requirement: PCE to ingress/egress LSR only flow signaling</name>

<t>There should be DetNet bounded latency options that for the purpose of traffic engineering
(including assurance of bounded latency across the network) only require per-flow 
Path Computation Engine (PCE) signaling to network ingress/egress router, but not to transit hop routers.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="requirement-support-for-diffserv-qos-model-on-transit-hops"><name>Requirement: Support for DiffServ QoS model on transit hops.</name>

<t>There should be DetNet bounded latency options that support the DiffServ QoS model instead
of only the IntServ model.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="requirement-low-jitter-bounded-latency-solutions"><name>Requirement: Low jitter bounded latency solutions.</name>

<t>There should be DetNet bounded latency options that together with the other requirements also
provide a better than worst-case jitter for DetNet traffic.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="requirement-dynamic-application-signalled-detnet-flows"><name>Requirement: Dynamic, application signalled DetNet flows</name>

<t>The DetNet architecture should support signaling and forwarding that would make support for
automatically application instantiated DetNet flows scalable and lightweight to operate.</t>


</section>
</section>
<section anchor="evolution"><name>Evolution of IP/MPLS network technologies and designs</name>

<t>To help readers understand especially the per-hop stateless requirement from above,
the following sections summarizes the historical evolution of technologies and operational
principles that the authors think are relevant to understand the requirements outlined
above and asks to see supported in DetNet.</t>

<section anchor="GS"><name>Guaranteed Service with RSVP</name>

<t>The original (first and only) IETF standardized packet forwarding layer standardized
queuing option for bounded latency in the IETF is "Guaranteed Service", <xref target="RFC2212"/> (GS),
see the DetNet bounded latency document, <xref target="DNBL"/> section 6.5. At the time the RFC was
published (1997), the standardized signaling was proposed to be RSVP <xref target="RFC2205"/>,
and the use of RSVP with GS was standardized in <xref target="RFC2210"/>.</t>

<t>The function to support GS bounded latency in the forwarding plane
is the per-flow reshaping on every forwarder hop along the path where GS packets
of one flow  may get delayed in the egress interface queue due to packets from
other GS flows. In typical networks, this is every hop along the path.</t>

<t>Early (1990/2000) forwarders for which RSVP was implemented where using
so-called "software" forwarding. This meant that the forwarding plane was
implemented through a general purpose CPU without additional hardware support
for QoS functions such as shaping or queuing.  While these forwarders did
support traffic flow shaping, GS was never implemented on them
and their RSVP implementations did also not support (but ignored) the RSVP
TSPEC/RSPEC signaling parameters used for bounded latency. Instead, RSVP
implementations only supported the parameters for bandwidth reservation,
which was henceforth called Call Admission Control (CAC).</t>

<t>In one instance, a software forwarder implementation with RSVP supported
the Controlled Load (CL) service <xref target="RFC2211"/>, which does not provide for
bounded but instead for controlled latency. This service is achieved by creating 
a per-flow queue and applying weighted fair queuing (WFQ) with weights
according to the reserved bandwidth of the flows (see <xref target="RFC2211"/>, section 11).
This functionality did not proliferate into later generations of routers
because the execution cost of WFQ was too high for a multitude of flows
and the scheduling accuracy was too inaccurate in interrupt driven CPU software
forwarding with higher speed interfaces (100Mbps...1Gbps).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="hardware-forwarding-and-diffserv"><name>Hardware forwarding and DiffServ</name>

<t>With the rise of forwarding planes with "acceleration" through ASIC based
Forwarding Plane Elements (FPE) instead of general purpose CPUs and/or dedicated
QoS hardware, the ability of forwarders to support shaping  evolved to only be
supported, if at all, on DiffServ (DS) boundary nodes, but not on DS interior
nodes. This included both shaping as well as complex queuing such as WFQ.</t>

<t>The DS architecture, <xref target="RFC2475"/>, was specifically targeted to enable the evolving,
now common Service Provider network services architecture, in which "high-touch"
service functions are only performed on so-called Provider Edge (PE) routers,
which as required are DS boundary nodes, whereas the hop-by-hop forwarding
through so-called Provider (P) (core) routers is meant to utilize only a reduced
set of forwarding functions, specifically excluding per-hop, per-flow QoS
forwarding plane functions such as shaping or policing. DiffServ therefore allowed
to build higher speed, lower cost forwarding plane P routers. It also enabled
to build equally higher speed, lower costs PE routers by supporting
boundary node functions only on (lower speed) customer facing interfaces/line cards,
but not on core facing interfaces.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="mpls-and-rsvp-te"><name>MPLS and RSVP-TE</name>

<t>With the advent of MPLS <xref target="RFC3031"/>, RSVP was extended to support MPLS through the
RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209"/> extensions. RSVP-TE manages p2p (later on also p2mp) MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSP),
which when signaled through RSVP-TE are also called RSVP-TE tunnels. These can be seen
as the equivalent of IP flows that RSVP manages for IP.  RSVP-TE tunnels can support
a variety of traffic engineering functions, but none of the implementations 
known to the authors ever implemented GS or CL services, specifically because
hardware forwarding for service provider networks was not designed to support
these QoS functions for P Label Switched Routers (LSR).</t>

<t>Because CL/GS where not targeted with RSVP-TE, the signaling extensions for
Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) required in the classical RSVP-TE reservation
model (such as <xref target="RFC8570"/> for IS-IS) have no parameters to signal
per-hop GS queuing latency or buffer capacity utilization. In result, the existing
IGP signaling for RSVP-TE  only supports RSVP-TE to perform bandwidth but not non-queuing
path latency resource calculations and therefore no latency based traffic engineering.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="path-computation-engines-pce"><name>Path Computation Engines (PCE)</name>

<t>Even though RSVP-TE implementations support only DiffServ (but not GS/CL) with respect
to per-hop QoS functions, its traffic-steering (path selection) and signaling
model introduced per-flow (per-tunnel) control plane and forwarding plane
overhead onto every P-hop. Through the 200x's, this RSVP-TE overhead was seen as
undesirable complexity and overhead by many service providers using it. There
was also a much larger number of service providers that desired some of the benefits provided
by RSVP-TE, but who were not willing to commit to the complexity, costs and operational risk
introduced into the network by complex per-flow signaling of RSVP-TE. The on-path, per-hop signaling
of RSVP-TE for example introduced so much overhead, that reconvergence of RSVP-TE
paths after a failure or recovery took as much as 20 minutes in networks with
10,000 or more RSVP-TE tunnels.</t>

<t>The design of RSVP-TE's (decentralized) on path signaling model specifically showed problematic
under high resource utilization. In the original, decentralized RSVP-TE deployment model,
ingress PE LSR would perform so-called Constrained Shored Path Forwarding (CSPF) calculations
to determine the shortest path with enough free resources for a new flow. Afterwards the
ingress PE would signal the path via RSVP-TE. The IGP would signal to all ingress PE
how many (bandwidth) resources where left on every link. Under high load, when multiple
ingress PE where performing this process in parallel this would cause high load, churn
and reservation collisions.</t>

<t>These problems of de-centralized RSVP-TE plus IGP signaling lead to the introduction of
a so-called Path Computation Element (PCE) based architecture, in which the (competing and uncoordinated)
traffic engineering computations on every de-centralized RSVP-TE ingress LSR where replaced by a centralized PCE
function (or at least a coordinated PE function), which would send the calculated
results back as a path object to the headend LSR, in result limiting the functions of RSVP-TE
to the signaling of a steered traffic path through the network to establish the hop-by-hop LSP.
The use of a PCE can likewise eliminate all the reservation state dependent signaling
from the RSVP-TE IGP extensions, because all the reservation calculations solely
need to happen only on the PCE. Nevertheless, the PCE does not eliminate the per-hop
signaling overhead of RSVP-TE to establish LSPs and hence it did not eliminate for example
the majority of the platform and convergence cost of RSVP-TE in the network, especially for
the control plane of P nodes adn could hence not resolve the concerns of service providers
who had chosen not to adopt RSVP-TE.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sr"><name>Segment Routing (SR)</name>

<t>The introduction of centralized PCE had obsoleted most of the reasons for RSVP: headends did
not need to do path calculation, and P router did not need to manage the available and allocated
bandwdth for TE tunnels. In most service-provider use-cases this left RSVP-TE only serving
as a very complex solution to do traffic steering, and the PCE was doing the rest. 
This ultimately lead to the design of the Segment Routing <xref target="RFC8402"/> architecture, and
its mapping to the MPLS forwarding plane, SR-MPLS <xref target="RFC8660"/>. Later, a mapping to IPv6 was
defined with SRv6 <xref target="RFC8986"/>.  SR relies on strict or loose hop-by-hop hop source routing
information, contained in each packet header, therefore eliminating the need to set up
per-path flow state via RSVP-TE, and allowed in conjunction with DiffServ for hop-by-hop QoS a complete
per-hop, per-flow stateless forwarding solution, arguably therefore lightweight, easy to implement
at  high performance and scalable to large number of flows.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="bier"><name>BIER</name>

<t>In the same way as SR eliminated the need for hop-by-hop traffic steering forwarding state
from RSVP-TE in P-routers for unicast traffic, Bit Indexed Explicit Replication
<xref target="RFC8279"/> (BIER) solves this problem for shortest path multicast replication state across
P-routers, by replacing it with a BIER packet header <xref target="RFC8296"/> and therefore eliminating
any per-application/flow, per-hop forwarding state for multicast in P-routers. BIER also removed
the associated overhead of prior ingress replication solutions Service Providers where
looking into to avoid the per-hop state.</t>

<t>Finally, BIER-TE <xref target="I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch"/> adds traffic steering with replication to the BIER architecture
and calls this Tree Engineering. Likewise, this is without the need for per-hop/per-flow steering
or replication state.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="summary-1"><name>Summary</name>

<t>Service Provider networks have evolved especially in the past 25 years into an architecture,
where high-speed, low-cost and high-reliability are based on designs that eliminate or reduce
as much as possible any form of unnecessary control-plane and even more so per-flow, per-application
plane complexity from P-routers/transit-nodes.</t>

<t>This has led to the development of the DiffServ QoS architecture that eliminated IntServ/per-flow
QoS from P-routers, and later on to the evolution from MPLS/RSVP-TE to SR and BIER that
eliminated per-flow/tunnel forwarding/steering and replication state from the same P-nodes.</t>

<t>Finally, early experience with Traffic Engineering churn under high load
and todays requirements for often NP-complete optimization lead to an architectural
preference for off-path/centralized model for TE calculations via PCE to also free P-routers
from signaling complexity and perform dynamic/service-dependent signaling only to PE-routers.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="additional-current-considerations"><name>Additional current considerations</name>

<t>The following subsections look at further into the background for why per-hop, per-flow state
can be problematic and discuss problems beyond this core issue.</t>

<section anchor="impact-of-application-based-state-in-networks"><name>Impact of application based state in networks</name>

<t>RSVP-TE was (and is) solely used for services where the operator of a domain explicitly
provisions RSVP-TE tunnels across its domain (for example using a PCE) and can therefore
fairly easily know the worst-case scaling impact. For example the number of tunnels does is not a chance value
arising through dynamic subscriber action, and the number of tunnels in the network is primarily
impacted by topological changes and the (over time relatively rare) of occurrences of additional
services and/or service instances being provisioned. For RSVP-TE there was never (to the
knowledge of the authors) an end-to-end application layer interface such as there was for RSVP over IP,
for example as supported by earlier versions of Microsoft Windows QoS enabled IP sockets.</t>

<t>When per-flow operations including per-hop signaling or even worse per-hop forwarding plane
or QoS state is not a result of well-controlled provisioning or well plannable/predictable
failure behavior but instead driven by applications not under the control of network
operators, the per-hop state requirements can become much more an operational and cost problem,
because of its unpredictability.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="experience-from-ip-multicast"><name>Experience from IP multicast</name>

<t>The widest experience with dynamic, application based signaling in Service Provider networks likely
exist for IP multicast, where creation of per-hop forwarding/replication state is
triggered by applications not under the control of network operations but by customer managed
applications/application-instances. Managing the amount of state and the control plane load
on P-routers was and is one of the mayor concerns when operationalizing IP Multicast services
in SPs.</t>

<t>Service Provider L2-VPN and L3-VPN services can offer IP Multicast via architectures such as <xref target="RFC6513"/>
that attempt to solve/reduce the problem of customer application driven, per-multicast application
in a variety of ways, but they all come with their own problems:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>In ingress-replication, the ingress-PE sends a separate unicast copy to every egress-PE. This 
creates significant excess traffic on links close to the ingress-PE and potentially higher-cost 
ingress-PE attachment speeds.</t>
  <t>In L3VPN aggregates-trees, the traffic for multiple trees is sent across a common tree 
reaching the superset of all egress-PE of all included trees. This reduces the number 
of trees from one per-customer application to a lower number of aggregates this, but it 
creates potentially significant excess traffic towards egress-PE that do not need all 
the aggregated traffic and may even result in a requirement for access core access 
link speeds for those egress routers.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Finally, the per P-router stateless BIER solution solved these issues. It does not require
any per P-router, per tree state creation, and achieves a 256x better traffic efficiency
than ingress replication (with 256 long BIER bit strings).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="network-types"><name>Service Provider and Private MPLS Networks</name>

<t>With DetNet services being targeted primarily for so-called private networks such as (but not
limited to) those for industrial, theme parks, power supply systems, road, river, airport and  train
transportation networks, it is important to understand how concerns for SP networks will
apply to such private networks:</t>

<t>While the aforementioned evolution of MPLS networks focused on large-scale service provider
networks, the very same architectural evolution is or will also happen in any private
MPLS networks in the same way as the DiffServ architecture equally became the only
widely adopted QoS architecture in any larger scale (campus or beyond) private networks.</t>

<t>While some of the scaling, cost, performance and reliability issues mentioned above for
service providers may not equally apply to smaller scale private networks, past experience
has shown that that it is unlikely for a critical mass for different solutions to develop across 
a large variety of vertical private type of networks. For this reason, in the past
any larger scale enterprise networks have preferred to adopt solutions that had proven
themselves through SP deployments and that where based on cross-vendor IETF based architecture principles
and widely, interoperable vendor implementations.</t>

<t>Another reason for private network operators looking for service provider calls designs
is that it also is simplifies potential service provider based management of the network
and/or outsourcing of the network to a service provider. This was seen often when large
enterprises that had to support multi-tenants evolved from ad-hoc network virtualization
solutions (such as VRF-lite) over to BGP/MPLS-VPN designs and later outsourced those very networks.</t>

<t>In that same line of future proofing, networking technologies first developed for enterprises
would also be picked up and reused in Service Provider networks as long as they would fit.
IP Multicast for example had (since about 1996) ca. 10 years of deployment for
business critical enterprise use cases (such as financial market data distribution), before
it was adopted widely for IPTV in service providers.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="shared-infra"><name>Mission-specific vs. shared infrastructures</name>

<t>Whereas the previous section points to the practice and benefits to share technologies
between private and SP network, this section highlights one core additional
requirement of SP networks not found in most private networks from which pre-DetNet
deterministic service requirements will likely originate.</t>

<t>In architectural terms, the desire and need to minimize or avoid per-application/flow
forwarding/control-plane state and per-hop control plane interactions (be it through
on-path signaling or direct PCE to P-router signaling) is not primarily a matter of SP/private
networks or not even of size, but foremost a matter of whether or not the network
itself is seen as the (a) communications fabric of a large distributed application
or (b) as an independently running shared infrastructure across
a potentially wide variety of application/services with diverging requirements.</t>

<t>(a) is the dominant view of the network specifically from many (single) mission specific networks
such as many industrial networks and even non-public High Performance Compute (HPC) center architectures. 
In either of these case, it is a single architectural entity that can control both network infrastructure
and application to build a mission optimized compound.</t>

<t>For example, switches in HPC Data Centers had traditionally very shallow interface packet
buffering for cost reasons, resulting in inferior performance under peak load with predominant
older TCP congestion control stacks. Instead of using better, more expensive switches, it
was easier to improve application device TCP stacks, leading for example to BBR TCP. While
this is very much in line with the desired Internet architecure that is putting a 
significant responsibility onto transport layer protocols in hosts (not limited to TCP)
to behave "fair" or "ideal", the reality even in many private missions centric networks
such as manufacturing plant is different. Dealing with misbehaving user devics or
applications is one of the main challenge. In the example, that is the case when a DC
is offering public cloud services, where TCP stacks can not be controlled, and hence
deeper buffers and/or better AQM are a core requirement.</t>

<t>In general: In networks following the (b) shared infrastructure design principle, any resource
that needs to be shared across different services or even service instances becomes
a potential three party reliability and costing issue between the provider running
the network and the two (or more) parties whose services utilize the common resource.
Minimizing the total amount of complex, failure-prone and hard to quantify in a cost-effective
manner shared resources is thus at the base of any shared infrastructure network design.</t>

<t>This again points to the model, where all network control can happen on the edge, and
due to the absence of per-hop, per-flow state there simply is no shared flow state table
that needs to be managed across multiple different services/subscribers.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ptp-and-challenges-with-clock-synchronization"><name>PTP and challenges with clock synchronization</name>

<t>Some bounded latency solution require accurate clock synchronization across network
nodes performing the bounded latency algorithm. The most commonly used (family of) protocol(s) for this is 
the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), standardized in IEEE1588 and various
market specific profiles thereof.</t>

<t>PTP can achieve long-term Maximum Time Interval Errors (MTIE) of
as little as 10th of nsec. MTIE is the maximum time difference between the clocks
of two PTP nodes measured over long period of time.</t>

<t>Implementing PTP in devices comes at a range of design requirements. At high degree
of accuracy, PTP requires accordingly accurate local oscillators that includes
hardware such as regulated heating to operate under constant temperature. It includes accurate
distribution of clock across all components of the system, which can be especially
challenging in modular, large-scale devices, and accurate insertion and retrieval
of timestamp field into packet headers.</t>

<t>While PTP is becoming more and more widely available, consistent support of high
accuracy across all target type of switches and routers in wide area networks 
cannot be taken for granted to be a feasible new requirement raised for DetNet
when it did not exist in before. Today, PTP is often found in mobile network
fronthauls, but not their backhauls or any other broadband aggregation, distribution
or core networks. This is because there is, as of today, no strong
business case requirement for PTP at high precision in those networks, whereas
technologies such as eCPRI raise such requirements against mobile fronthauls.
Instead, those other networks most often resort to at best msec accuracy NTP protocol
deployments which is typically sufficient for control-plane and operational event tracing
as its main, accuracy defining use-case.</t>

<t>The larger the network and more multi-vendor varied the deployed equipment is, the 
higher will also be the operational cost of maintaining and controlling the accuracy
of a PTP service. This primarily has been cited in the past as a reason to
not deploy PTP even if hardware was supporting it. This operational challenge
will especially apply when PTP support may be required for only a small
percentage of traffic in a high speed wide area network. The revenue from the
service needs to cover the operational cost incurred by its exclusive components
(hardware, software and operations).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="jitter-in-time-versus-on-time"><name>Jitter - in-time versus on-time</name>

<t>This section discusses how low-jitter bounded latency applications can be highly
beneficial for DetNet applications.</t>

<t>Depending on the bounded latency algorithm, the jitter experienced by packets varies
based on the amount of competing traffic. In algorithms and their resulting
end-to-end service which this memo calls "in-time", such as GS and <xref target="TSN-ATS"/>, the experienced
latency in the absence of any competing traffic is zero, and in the presence of the
maximum amount of permissible competing traffic, latency is the maximum, guaranteed
bounded latency. In result, the jitter provided by these algorithms is the highest possible.</t>

<t>In algorithms and their resulting end-to-end service which this memo calls "on-time",
 the experienced latency is completely or most significantly independent of the amount of competing
traffic and the jitter therefore null or minimal. In these algorithms, the network
buffers packets when they are earlier than guaranteed, whereas in-time algorithms 
deliver packets (almost) as fast as possible.</t>

<t>This memo argues that on-time queuing algorithms provide an additional value-add
over in-time algorithms, especially for use in metropolitan or wide-area networks.
Whatever algorithm is used, the receiving application only has a guarantee for
the maximum bounded latency, and the real (shorter) latency of any received packet is no
indication for the latency of the next packet. Instead, the receiver application has
to be prepared for each and any future packet to arrive with the worst possible,
e.g.: the bounded latency.</t>

<t>The majority of applications require  some higher layer function synchronously
to the sender application: Rendering of audio/video and other media information needs
to happen at the same frequency or event intervals at which the media was encoded. When
 these applications receive packets earlier than the time at which they can be processed
(which is equal or close to the bounded latency), these applications buffer media
in a so-called playout buffer and release them only at that target time. Likewise,
remote control loops including industrial Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) loops or
remote controlling of robots or cars is typically based on synchronous operations.
In these applications, early packets are also delayed to then be processed "synchronously"
later.</t>

<t>In all cases, where applications need to buffer (or otherwise remember) received data
when it is too early, in-time queueing latency raises the challenge to application developers
to be able to predict the networks worst possible jitter, and this can be particularly challenging
for embedded, if not constrained receiver devices with minimum memory to buffer/remember.
When these devices are designed against one particular type of network with well-known low jitter,
then they will not necessarily operate correctly in networks with larger jitter. And
in metropolitan and WAN networks, jitter with in-time services can be highly variable
based on its design and the relative location of the communicating nodes in the topology
(see <xref target="reference"></xref> for an example network design).</t>

<t>One example of such issues was encountered when digital TV receivers (Set Top Boxes, STB)
designed for (mostly synchronous) digital cable transmission where evolved to become
IPTV STB, but the playout buffer of &lt; 50 msec was not sufficient to compensate for
a &gt; 50 msec jitter experienced in IP metropolitan networks.</t>

<t>Note that this section does not claim that all applications will benefit from on-time
service, nor that no application would benefit more from in-time service than from
on-time service. Nevertheless, the authors are not aware of instances of <xref target="RFC8578"/>
application for whom in-time service would be more beneficial than on-time service.
Of course, this comparison is only about the benefit to the application and other
factors such as the cost/scale of the service for the network itself have also to be
taken into account.</t>

<section anchor="hw-challenges"><name>Challenges for high-speed packet forwarding hardware</name>

<t>The problems of cost and operational feasibility in shared-infrastructure networks specifically
 applies to scaling of hardware resources such as per-application-flow
forwarding or QoS state in high-speed network routers: Even if the business case makes it
clear that only e.g. 1 Gbps worth of traffic may require this advanced state (such as
multicast replication or per-flow shaping for bounded latency), it will be
more expensive to build this functionality into a 100 Gbps transit switch/router than into a 1 Gbps
switch/router. This too is based on experience from migrating services of low-speed
mission specific networks, such as IP multicast onto high speed, shared-infrastructure 
service provider networks.</t>

<t>The reason for this higher cost at higher speed is that the 1 Gbps worth of "advanced" traffic still has
to be built into 100 times faster hardware and each of the "advanced" packets forwarded would
needs to be replicated/shaped 100 times faster.</t>

<t>This packet processing issue may look like it applies equally to both per-hop, per-flow stateful
 based forwarding as well as solely in-packet based mechanisms, in practice,
per-flow state may requires a lot more high-speed memory access because of the need to access
an entry from a state table. In most cases, this table space can only be made to work
at line rate packet processing when it is on-chip, hence it is not only most expensive, it is
also crucial to scale right. And as the 1 vs. 100 Gbps example above showed, it is very hard to
come by an appropriate scale smaller than "would work for 100% of traffic" - because 
network operator providing shared infrastructure networks really do not want to be responsible for
predicting how individual services may grow in adoption by making a specific hardware selection
that constrains any such grows.</t>

<t>Last, but not least, on-chip high-speed state tables become even more expensive when they
do not only have to be read only, but also when they have to be written at line rate and
even worse, when they have to operate for line-rate speed read/write/read control loops:</t>

<t>The main issue with scaling state in hardware routers is that designs will be hesitant
to work against unclear growth predictions. Even if at some point in time only 1 Gbps
of DetNet traffic was expected to be required on a 100 Gbps platform,
hardware designers will be much more likely want to scale against the worst (best) case
service growth expectation so that customers will not feel that they would buy into a 
product that becomes obsolete under success.</t>

<t>Whereas steering state, such as MPLS label entries can easily scale to hundreds of
thousands, the same is not clear about shapers or interleaved regulators. They are more
challenging because they require fast (on-chip) read-write memory for the state
variables, especially when forwarding is parallelized across multiple execution unit.
This does incur additional complexity to split up the state and its packets across
multiple execution units and/or to provide consistent cross-execution units shared read/writeable memory.</t>

<t>Even only writeable (but not cross-execution units then also readable) memory has
traditionally been a sparse resource the faster the forwarding engines are. This
can be seen from (often very limited) scale of packet monitoring state such as for IPfix.</t>

<t>But the main issue of per-hop, per-flow forwarding state that could be quite dynamic
because it might be triggered by applications is the control plane to forwarding-plane-state
interactions. Updating hardware forwarding engine state tables is often one
of the key performance limits of routers. Adding significant additional state with likely
ongoing changes is easily seen as a big contributor to churn in the control plane
and likely reason for stability and reduced peak performance under key events such as
reconvergence of all or large parts of IGP or BGP routing tables.</t>

<section anchor="reference"><name>A reference network design</name>

<t>The following picture shows an example, worst-case network
topology of interest (in the opinion of the authors) for bounded
latency considerations. This section does not claim that greenfield
rollouts may or want to use all aspects of this topology. What
his memo does claim is that many existing brownfield networks, especially
large metropolitan areas show all or many of these
aspects, and that it would be prudent for bounded latency network
technologies to support networks like these so as to not create
new constraints against network designers by only supporting
physical network topologies optimized for a particular type of
service (bounded latency).</t>

<t>An example metropolitan scale network as shown in <xref target="FIG-network"/> may consist of one or more
rings of forwarders. A ring provides the minimum cost n+1 redundancy
between the ring nodes, especially when, as is common in metropolitan networks,
new fibre cannot cost-effectively be put into new optimum trenches,
but existing fibre and/or trenches have to be used. This is specifically
true when the area includes not dense populated suburban areas (higher
cost per subscriber and mile for rollouts).</t>

<t>Multiple, so-called subtended rings typically occur when existing
networks are expanded into new areas: A new ring is simply connected
at two most economic points into the existing infrastructure. Likewise,
such a topology may become more complicated over time by addition
of capacity, which resulting from TE planning calculations may not
follow any of the pre-existing ring paths.</t>

<t>Edge Data-Center (DC), connections to Exchanges/Peerings or national
cores of the provider itself, as well as all subscribers including
Mobile Network Towers, and IoT devices connect to these ring directly 
via PE edge-forwarders and (more often) via additional CE type devices.
P nodes may also double as PE nodes.</t>

<t>In densely populated regions, P, or PE nodes may have a high number
of attached devices, shown in the picture with the example of 100
PE forwarder connecting to a single P forwarder (or rather two
P for redundancy and therefore support of PREOF).</t>

<t>In summary, the following aspects of these networks are relevant
for bounded latency:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Link speeds today are at least 100 Gbps and will be Tbps in the
near future. Even if only a small percentage of that traffic has to
support bounded latency, the queuing mechanism need to support these
high-speed interfaces.</t>
  <t>Fan-in/out at PE or P nodes may be (worst case) in the order of
hundred(s) of incoming interfaces. Bounded latency mechanisms whose
number of queues depend on the number (#I) of interfaces in a more
than linear fashion, such as (#I^2) in the case of <xref target="TSN-ATS"/>, may
introduce significant challenges for cost-effective hardware.</t>
  <t>Through the advent of decentralized edge Data Center and peerings between
different operators and content providers, traffic flows of interest
will not solely be between one central site from/to subscribers hub&amp;spoke.
Instead arbitrary, traffic engineered paths across the topology
between any two edges need to be supportable in scale with the 
bounded latency queuing mechanism.</t>
  <t>The total number of edge (#E) nodes (PE or CE) for a bounded latency service
can easily be in the thousands. Aggregation of bounded latency flows
on the order of (#E^2), which is the best option in per-hop, per-flow
solutions such as <xref target="TSN-ATS"/>, is likely insufficient to significantly reduce
the number of flows that need to be managed across P nodes in such
bounded latency queuing mechanisms.</t>
  <t>The total number of P nodes may be in the hundreds and bounded latency
flows in the tenths of thousands. It should also be expected that such
flows are not necessarily long-term static but may need to be provisionable
in the time-scale order of for example telephone calls (such as flows supporting<br />
remote control of devices or operations). Bounded latency solutions that
require per-flow, per-node state maintenance on the P nodes themselves
may therefore be undesirable from a network operational/complexity/reliability 
perspective, but also from a hardware engineering cost perspective, especially
with respect to the control plane cost of dynamically setting up per-flow
bounded latency for flow whenever there is a new flow or all of them whenever
there are topology or load changes that make rerouting desirable.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Beyond queuing concerns, path selection too specifically for deterministic
services is a challenge in these networks:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Path lengths may be significantly longer than e.g. 3 hops.
In large metropolitan networks, they can reach 20 or more hops.
Speed of light end-to-end in these networks will be in the order of
low number of msec. End-to-end queuing latency can be in the same range,
if not higher.</t>
  <t>To avoid undesirable re-routing under failure when PREOF and
engineered disjoint paths are used, traffic steering needs to
support efficiently supportable hop-by-hop traffic steering. In networks
designed for source-routing (e..: SR routing), efficiently encoded
strict-hop-by-hop steering for as much as those (e.g.: 20) hops may
be desirable to support.</t>

<section anchor="standardized-bounded-latency-algorithms"><name>Standardized Bounded Latency algorithms</name>

<t><xref target="DNBL"/> gives an overview of the math for the most well-known
existing deterministic bounded latency algorithms/solutions. This section reviews the relevant
currently standardized algorithms from the perspective of the above listed problems for high-speed,
high-scale, shared services infrastructures and to provide additional background about them.</t>

<section anchor="guaranteed-service-gs"><name>Guaranteed Service (GS)</name>

<t>GS is described in section 6.5 of <xref target="DNBL"/>. <xref target="GS"></xref> describes its historical evolution and challenges.
We skip further detailing of its issues here to concentrate on IEEE Time Synchronuous Networking - Asynchronous Traffic Shaping <xref target="TSN-ATS"/>,
which in general is seen as superior to GS for high speed hardware implementation. All the
concerns described in the TSN-ATS section apply equally or even  more to GS.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="tsn-asynchronous-traffic-shaping-tsn-ats"><name>TSN Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (TSN-ATS)</name>

<t>Section 6.4 of <xref target="DNBL"/> describes the bounded latency used for TSN Asynchronous
Traffic Shaping <xref target="TSN-ATS"/>. Like GS, this bounded latency solution also relies on per-flow
shaper state, except that it uses optimized shapers called "Interleaved Regulator" as explained
in section 4.2.1 of <xref target="DNBL"/>.</t>

<t>The concept and simplification in interleaved regulators
over traditional shapers and the concept of interleaved regulators is a resulting from 
mathematical work done in the last 10 years starting with <xref target="UBS"/>.</t>

<t>In a system with e.g. N=10,000 flows each with a shaper, the forwarder needs to have 
10,000 shapers each of which would need to calculate the earliest feasible send-time
of the first queued packet of the flow and all these send-times would need to be compared
by a scheduler picking the absolute first packet to send. Of course it is unlikely that
the router would have to queue at least one packet for all queues at any point in time,
but the complexity to implement the scheduler scales with N.</t>

<t>With interleaved regulators,
there is still the per-flow state required to hold each flows traffic parameters and
its next-packet earliest departure time, but instead of requiring a scheduler to compare
N entries, packets are queued into one out of (#IIF,#PRIO) FIFO queues, one queue for all the
packets arriving from the same Incoming InterFace (IIF) and targeted the same
worst-case queuing latency/PRIOrity (PRIO) on this hop. The shaper now only needs to calculate the earliest
departure time of the head of each of these M= #IIF * #PRIO queues and the complexity of
a scheduler to select the first packet across those interleave regulators is therefore
reduced by a factor of O(N/M).</t>

<t>Unfortunately, while industrial ethernet switches today often have no more than 24 IIF, aggregation
routers in metropolitan networks may have thousands of IIF, so the benefit of interleaved
regulators over per-flow shaper will likely be much higher in classical TSN environments than it
would be for example likely DetNet target routers in metropolitan networks.</t>

<t>In addition, the aforementioned core problems for shapers (<xref target="hw-challenges"></xref>), namely control
plane, read/write/read cycle access and scale equally apply to interleaved regulators, so
the main optimization benefits of interleaved regulators is for the original targets of <xref target="UBS"/> / <xref target="TSN-ATS"/>:
low-speed (1..10Gbps switches) with limited number of interfaces - but to a much lower degree
for likely important type of DetNet deployments.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="CQF-section"><name>Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF)</name>

<t>TSN Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding as described in <xref target="DNBL"/>, section 6.6, is a per-flow, per-transit-hop
stateless forwarding mechanism, which solves the concerns with per-hop, per-flow state issues
described earlier in this memo. It also provides an on-time service in which the per-hop and
end-to-end jitter is very small, namely in the order of a cycle time.</t>

<t><xref target="CQF"/> operates by forwarders sending packets in periodic cycles.
These cycles are derived from clock synchronization: The start of each cycle (and by implication
the end of the prior cycle) are simply periodically increasing clock timestamps that have to be
synchronized across adjacent forwarders, usually via PTP. This method to operate cycles
allows <xref target="CQF"/> to operate without additional <xref target="CQF"/> data packet headers, but it is also the reason for the
two issues of <xref target="CQF"/>, and both relate to the so-called dead time (DT).</t>

<t>For the receiving node to correctly associate a <xref target="CQF"/> packet to the same cycle as the sending
node, the last bit of the last packet in the cycle on the sending node needs to be received by the
receiving node before the cycle ends.</t>

<t><xref target="DNBL"/> explains that DT is the sum of latencies 1,2,3,4
as of <xref target="DNBL"/> Figure 1, but that is missing the MTIE between the forwarders: 
If a cycle is for example 10 usec, and the PTP MTIE is 1 usec, then only 9 usec of
the cycle could be used (without even yet considering the other factors contributing to MTIE).
If MTIE is not taken into account, a packet might arrive in time from the perspective of the
sending forwarder, but not in the perspective of the 1 usec earlier receiving node.</t>

<t>In practice, MTIE should be equal or lower than 1% of the cycle time. When forwarders and links 
increase in speed, cycle times could become proportionally smaller to reduce per-hop cycle time latency.
When this is done, MTIE needs to equally become smaller, raising the costs of the solution. Therefore,
<xref target="CQF"/> has a challenge with higher speed networks.</t>

<t>The second and even more important problem is that DT includes the link latency (2 in
<xref target="DNBL"/>, Figure 1). With a speed of light in fibre of 200,000 Km, link latency is 10 usec
for 2 Km. This makes <xref target="CQF"/> very problematic and limited in metropolitan and wide-area
networks. If the longest link of a network was 10 Km, this would cause a DT on that link
of 50 usec and with a cycle time of 100 usec, only 50% bandwidth could be used for cycle-time
(bounded latency) traffic (excluding all other DT factors).</t>

<t>When links are subject to thermal expansion also known as sag on hanging wires, such as broadband
copper wires (Cable Networks), their length can also change by as much as 20% between noon and night temperatures,
which without changes in the design has to be taken into account as part of DT.</t>

<t>In conclusion, <xref target="CQF"/> solves many of the problems discussed in this memo, but it's reliance on
timestamp synchronized cycles may pose undesirable challenges with the required accuracy of
 PTP in high speed network and especially limits <xref target="CQF"/> ability to support wider-scale networks due to DT.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="candidate-solution-directions"><name>Candidate solution directions</name>

<t>As this memo outlines, per-hop, per-flow stateless forwarding is the one
core requirement for to support Gbps speed metropolitan or wide-area networks.</t>

<t>This section gives an overview and evaluation from the perspective of the authors of
this memo of currently known non-standardized proposals for per-hop-stateless forwarding
with the explicit goal and/or possibility of bounded latency forwarding and in relationship. 
to the concerns and desires described in the previous sections.</t>

<section anchor="packet-tagging-based-cqf"><name>Packet tagging based CQF</name>

<t>To overcome the challenges outlined in <xref target="CQF-section"></xref>, <xref target="I-D.qiang-DetNet-large-scale-DetNet"/> and
 <xref target="I-D.dang-queuing-with-multiple-cyclic-buffers"/> (tagged-CQF) propose a modified <xref target="CQF"/> mechanism
in which timestamp based cycle indication of <xref target="CQF"/> is replaced by indicating the senders cycle in
an appropriate packet header field, so that the receiver can accordingly map the received
packet to the right local cycle.</t>

<t>This approach completely eliminates the link-latency as a factor
impacting the effectiveness of the mechanism, because in this approach, the link latency
does not impact the DT. Instead the link latency is used to calculate which cycle from the
sender needs to be mapped to which cycle on the receiver, and this is programmd during
setup of links into the receiving routers cycle mapping table.</t>

<t>Depending on the number of cycles configured, it is also possible to compensate for
variability in the link-latency and higher MTIE (picture TBD). If one more cycle is used
for example, this would allow for MTIE to be the order of one cycle time as opposed to
a likely target of 1% of cycle time as in <xref target="CQF"/>, reducing the required PTP clock accuracy by
a factor of 100. This possible reduction in required accuracy of operations by appropriate
configuration does not only cover PTP but also extends into any forwarding operation within
the nodes, e.g.: it could also reduce the cost of implementation of forwarding hardware
at higher speeds accordingly.</t>

<t>In MPLS networks, packet tagged CQF with a small number of cycle tags (such as 3 or 4)
could easily be realized and standardized by relying on E-LSP where 3 or 4 EXP code
points would be used to indicate the cycle value. Given how such deterministic bounded
latency traffic is not subject to congestion control, it also does not require additional
ECN EXP code points, so those would be available for e.g.: best-effort traffic that
should use the same E-LSP.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="packet-tagging-based-cqf-with-sr"><name>Packet tagging based CQF with SR</name>

<t><xref target="I-D.chen-DetNet-sr-based-bounded-latency"/> applies the taged-CQF mechanisms to Segment Routing (SR)
by proposing SR style header elements to indicate the per-segment/hop cycle. This eliminates the
need to set up on every hop a cycle mapping table.</t>

<t>It is unclear to the authors of this memo
how big a saving this is given how the PCE would need to update all the ingress router per-flow
configurations where header imposition happens when links change, whereas the mapping table approach
would require only localized changes on the affected routers.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="srtsn"><name>Per-hop latency indications for Segment Routing</name>

<t><xref target="I-D.stein-srtsn"/> describes a mechanism in which a source-routed header in the spirit of a Segment Routing (SR)
header can be used to enable a per-transit-hop per-flow stateless latency control. For every hop,
a maximum latency is specified. The draft outlines a control plane which similarly to packet
tagging based CQF or <xref target="TSN-ATS"/> would put the work of admitting flows, determining their paths and admitting
their resources along those paths to some form of PCE/SDN-Controller.</t>

<t>The basic principle of forwarding in this proposal is to put received packets into
a priority heap and schedule them in order of their urgency (shortest latency) for this hop.</t>

<t>The draft explicitly does not prescribes specific algorithms on the forwarders to
take the indicated latency for the hop into account in a way that the controller can
calculate the resource availability, such as specific queuing or scheduling
algorithms.</t>

<t>It is not entirely clear to the authors of this memo, if the sole indication of
such deadline latencies is sufficient to completely eliminate per-transit-hop, per-flow
state and still achieve deterministic latency because of the <xref target="UBS"/> work.
Consider that the packets latency for a hop could be used to derive a priority
queue on the hop relative to other packets with higher or lower latency for this hop,</t>

<t>As was shown in the research work leading up to <xref target="TSN-ATS"/>, the priority queuing on
each hop alone is not sufficient to achieve a simple, solely per-hop calculated
latency bound under high load because of the problem of multi-hop burst aggregation and the
resulting hard to calculate incurred upper latency bound. To overcome that calculation
issue,  shapers or as in <xref target="TSN-ATS"/> their optimization, interleaved regulators, are 
used in <xref target="TSN-ATS"/> and GS.  Shapers/interleaved requires to maintain across packets
from the same flow  per-flow state.</t>

<t>Nevertheless, appropriate mathematical models for SDN controllers may be possible to develop
deterministic per-hop forwarding models relying not only on the per-hop indicated latency but
also on additional constraints such as limited number of hops or sufficiently low degrees of maximum
admitted amount of traffic. Or else this may be used for to be developed latency models that
are not 100% deterministic, but close enough in probability such that the amount of late
packets would be in the same order as otherwise unavoidable problems such as BER based packet loss.</t>

<t>To that end, the author of <xref target="I-D.stein-srtsn"/> has conducted simulations of the
proposed mechanism, contrasting it with other mechanisms. These results, which will be
published elsewhere, show hat this mechanism excels in cases with high load and a
small number of flows with tight budgets.  However, some small percentage of packets
will miss their end-to-end latency bounds, and must be treated as lost packets.</t>

<t>Depending on the algorithms chosen, solutions may or may not rely on strong, weak, or no
clock synchronization across nodes.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="lbf"><name>Latency Based Forwarding</name>

<t>"High-Precision Latency Forwarding over Packet-Programmable Networks", NOMS 2020 conference <xref target="LBF"/>
describes a framework for per-transit-hop, per-flow stateless forwarding based on
three packet parameters: The minimum and maximum desired end-to-end latency, set by
the sender and not changed by the network, and the experienced latency updated by
every hop. Routers supporting this LBF mechanism do also extend their routing (e.g.: IGP)
to be able to calculate the non-queueing latency towards the destination. Based on
the in-packet parameters and the future latency prediction are used to prioritize packets
in queuing including giving them higher priority when they are late due to prior hop incurred
latency, or delaying them when they are too early.</t>

<t>LBF was started as a more fundamental research into how application experience could
be improved when they are allowed to indicate such differential min/max latency Service Level
Objectives (SLO). Benefits include the ability to compensate for prior hop incurred
queuing latency, but also to automatically prioritize packets on a single hop based on their
future path length, all without the need for any explicit admission control.</t>

<t>The LBF algorithm is completely without need for clock synchronization across nodes. Instead,
it assumes mechanisms to know or learn link latency and the remaining latencies (as defined in
the DetNet architecture) can be calculated locally (e.g.: latency through a forwarder).</t>

<t>The authors have not yet tried to define a mathematical model that would
allow to derive completely deterministic behavior for this original LBF algorithm in conjunction with a
PCE/SDN controller. Due to the absence of per-flow (shaper/interleaved-regulator),
the authors believe that deterministic solutions would as outlined above for SRTSN (<xref target="srtsn"></xref>) likely only
be possible under additional assumed constraints.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="conclusions"><name>Conclusions</name>

<t>Bounded Latency for DetNet have been designed by trying to adopt solutions developed either
several decades ago (GS) or recently for limited scope and scale L2 networks <xref target="TSN-ATS"/>.</t>

<t>To allow DetNet solutions to explore opportunities in larger speed &amp; scale shared network
infrastructures, both private and service provider networks, it is highly desirable for
DetNet WG (and/or other IETF WGs claiming responsibility in conjunction with DetNet as the driver)
to explore the opportunities to standardize additional, and in the
opinion of the authors better per-hop forwarding models in support of (near) deterministic bounded
latency by mean of standardizing per-flow stateless/"DiffServ" style per-hop forwarding behavior (PHB) with
appropriate network packet header parameters.</t>

	 <t>This memo describes per-packet stateless strict and loose path steered replication and forwarding for &quot;Bit Index Explicit Replication&quot; (BIER) packets (RFC 8279); it is called &quot;Tree Engineering for Bit Index Explicit Replication&quot; (BIER-TE) and is intended to be used as the path steering mechanism for Traffic Engineering with BIER.

 BIER-TE introduces a new semantic for &quot;bit positions&quot; (BPs). These BPs indicate adjacencies of the network topology, as opposed to (non-TE) BIER in which BPs indicate &quot;Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers&quot; (BFERs). A BIER-TE &quot;packets BitString&quot; therefore indicates the edges of the (loop-free) tree across which the packets are forwarded by BIER-TE. BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little changes. Co-existence of BIER and BIER-TE forwarding in the same domain is possible -- for example, by using separate BIER &quot;subdomains&quot; (SDs). Except for the optional routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing underlay and can therefore operate without depending on a routing protocol such as the &quot;Interior Gateway Protocol&quot; (IGP).

      <abstract>
	 <t>   Routers perform two distinct user-plane functionalities, namely
   forwarding (where the packet should be sent) and scheduling (when the
   packet should be sent).  One forwarding paradigm is segment routing,
   in which forwarding instructions are encoded in the packet in a stack
   data structure, rather than programmed into the routers.  Time
   Sensitive Networking and Deterministic Networking provide several
   mechanisms for scheduling under the assumption that routers are time
   synchronized.  The most effective mechanisms for delay minimization
   involve per-flow resource allocation.

   SRTSN is a unified approach to forwarding and scheduling that uses a
   single stack data structure.  Each stack entry consists of a
   forwarding portion (e.g., IP addresses or suffixes) and a scheduling
   portion (deadline by which the packet must exit the router).  SRTSN
   thus fully implements network programming for time sensitive flows,
   by prescribing to each router both to-where and by-when each packet
   should be sent.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   One of the goals of DetNet is to provide bounded end-to-end latency
   for critical flows.  This document defines how to leverage Segment
   Routing (SR) to implement bounded latency.  Specifically, the SR
   Identifier (SID) is used to specify transmission time (cycles) of a
   packet.  When forwarding devices along the path follow the
   instructions carried in the packet, the bounded latency is achieved.
   This is called Cycle Specified Queuing and Forwarding (CSQF) in this
   document.

   Since SR is a source routing technology, no per-flow state is
   maintained at intermediate and egress nodes, SR-based CSQF naturally
   supports flow aggregation that is deemed to be a key capability to
   allow DetNet to scale to large networks.
