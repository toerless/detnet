<?line 173?>

<t>This memo specifies a forwarding method for bounded latency and bounded jitter for Deterministic Networks and is a variant of the IEEE TSN Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) method. Tagged CQF (TCQF) supports more than 2 cycles and indicates the cycle number via an existing or new packet header field called the tag to replace the cycle mapping in CQF which is based purely on synchronized reception clock.</t>

<t>This memo standardizes TCQF as a mechanism independent of the tagging method used. It also specifies tagging via the (1) the existing MPLS packet Traffic Class (TC) field for MPLS packets, (2)  the IP/IPv6 DSCP field for IP/IPv6 packets, and (3) a new TCQF Option header for IPv6 packets.</t>

<t>Target benefits of TCQF include low end-to-end jitter, ease of high-speed hardware implementation, optional ability to support large number of flow in large networks via DiffServ style aggregation by applying TCQF to
the DetNet aggregate instead of each DetNet flow individually, and support of wide-area DetNet
networks with arbitrary link latencies and latency variations as well as low accuracy clock synchronization.</t>

<section anchor="cyclic-queuing-and-forwarding-cqf"><name>Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF)</name>

<t>Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) is a bounded (guaranteed) per-hop
latency forwarding mechanism standardized for use in ethernet switched
networks by the IEEE TSN working group originally via <xref target="IEEE802.1Qch"/>
(802.1 Qch), which later became annex T of <xref target="IEEE802.1Q"/>.  See also <xref target="RFC9320"/>, Section 6.6.</t>

<t>CQF is not a separate forwarding mechanism, but it is simple a profile
of the IEEE Time Aware Shaper (TAS) standard, <xref target="IEEE802.1Qbv"/>, which introduce
Time-Gated Queues.</t>

<t>CQF uses a two-queue based forwarding mechanism on every switch along a
path between a sender and receiver. One queue is used to receive and
store frames destined toward a particular outgoing interface on the switch,
the other queue is used simultaneously to send frames to the same outgoing
interface. At every cycle time T_c interval these two queues are swapped, or
in terms of Time-Gated Queus, one is closed for sending, the other is opened
for sending. This operation is synchronized across all switches in the 
network by network wide synchronized clocks, so that all queues
open and close at the same time.</t>

<t>For a path of h hops, the end-to-end latency bound is between (h-1) * T_c + DT
and (h+1) * T_c. DT is the so-called dead time at the end of a cycle
during which no frames can be transmitted from the sending queue to ensure
that the last byte of the last frame will be received earlier than
the end of the same cycle on the receiving switch.</t>

<t>A core contributor to DT is the (physical) link between the sending
and receiving switch. DT needs to be larger than the latency of
this link, including physical propagation latency (speed of light), possible
error correction latencies, and interface serialization latency.</t>

<t>T_c needs to be choosen carefully: The larger it is, the higher the
bounded latency. The smaller it is, the fewer bytes (and hence frames)
will fit into a cycle.</t>

<t>To admit flows into a CQF network, the ingress switch uses per-flow
Time-Gated Queues. In the most simple case, such a gate is configured
to admit a maximum amount of bytes from the flow into every cycle. More
advanced admission control can be performed for bursty flows. For example
N bursty flows f_i = 0...(N-1) could share admitted bandwidth by each having their
burst admitted in different cycles c_i = c % N + c_i, where c is a continuous
increasing cycle number.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="highspeed"><name>Benefits of CQF with higher speed links</name>

<t>The typical CQF deployments in manufacturing networks with 1Gbps links
uses no less than hundreds of microseconds as a cycle interval.  In a
network with a small diameter, say less than 8 hops, it is sufficiently good to provide an
end-to-end latency bound in the order of several milliseconds.</t>

<t>With the increasing of link speed from 100Mbps to 1Gbps, 10Gbps, 100Gbps
or even higher in larger networks, either more bytes can be transmitted
within the same cycle interval or the smaller cycle interval is
required to transmit the same amount of bytes in a cycle as that in
low speed networks. Likewise, the serialization latency reduces with
higher speed links and DT reduces. This overall makes CQF for higher speed
networks more attractive than for lower speed networks.</t>

<t><xref target="Fig1"/> shows a simple calculation on the number of bytes that can
be transmitted in a cycle with different cycle intervals and link
speeds. A minimum of 1500 bytes is labeled with * as a baseline because
a typical maximum Ethernet frame is 1500 bytes and a selected cycle interval
should at least allow one such frame size to be transmitted unless
otherwise specified.</t>

<t>TBD: These numbers probbly need to be adjusted to reflect reducing DT based on
serialization latency.</t>

<t>When the link speed is at 10Gbps, the cycle interval could be as
small as 1.2 us if a 1500 byte frame needs to be transmitted in one
cycle interval, and with 100Gbps links even 1 usec cycle time
allows for 8 frames of 1500 byte each.  These are not accurate calculations because there are
certainly other factors to determine the cycle interval.  However, it
shows that as the link speed increases, cycle interval can be greatly
reduced in practice while satisfying the minimum amount of data
transmitted in a single cycle.  The end-to-end latency bound when
applying CQF is determined by cycle interval and number of hops.
That is to say, CQFs with a smaller cycle interval have the potential
to meet more strict end-to-end latency requirements in higher link
speed networks or meet the same end-to-end latency requirement in
networks with much larger network diameter (number of hops).</t>

<t>Industry automation has some typical application period requirement,
e.g.  100 us to 2 ms for isochronous traffic, 500 us to 1 ms for
cyclic-synchronous and 2 to 20 ms for cyclic-asynchronous traffic.
The network cycle interval is usually a fraction of the application
period.  When the cycle interval is in the order of tens of
microseconds, CQF can be used to meet the most strict end-to-end
latency requirements.  For instance, if we assume the number of hops
is 24, when cycle interval is set to 10us, the end-to-end latency
bound can be around (24+1)*10 = 250 us which has the potential to
meet the latency bound requirement for isochronous traffic.</t>

<t>In summary a higher speed network makes the shorter cycle interval
feasible because sufficiently large traffic volume can be transmitted
within one cycle interval.  A shorter cycle interval further offers
shorter end-to-end latency and jitter bounds which provide CQF with
the potentials to meet more strict latency requirements in wider
deployments while preserving its simplicity of latency calculation
and provisioning.  Therefore there is a strong motivation to leverage
CQF and at the same time to make cycle interval as short as possible.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="cqfdt"><name>Challenges of CQF with higher latency links</name>

<t>Unlike the original targets for IEEE TSN work, DetNet not only targets
to support IETF forwarding planes (IP, MPLS,...), but also wide-area
networks with therefore longer physcial propagation latencies.</t>

<t>As shown in <xref target="Fig2"/> for fundamental (two buffer) CQF, the last byte
sent by node A in cycle (i-1) has to be ready for sending at node B
before the start of cycle i.  To realize it, DT or dead time is
imposed.  It is a time interval usually at the end of a cycle so that
a node should not send the scheduled CQF packets.</t>

<t>Dead time is at least the sum of the maximum propagation delay to the
next node, the maximum processing delay at the next node and the
maximum other time variations.  Therefore either the longer
propagation or longer processing delay makes dead time larger.
Packets from DetNet service is likely to be propagated over long
links in the wider area.  It takes around 5us per kilometer to
propagate, i.e. 0.5ms every hundred kilometers.  Hence the dead time
can be as large as milliseconds or tens of milliseconds in case of
hundred kilometers of longer links and larger processing delays.
That would make the dead time eat up most of the cycle interval when
cycle interval is short (e.g., at the same order or one order higher
of magnitude in time as dead time).  Then the useful time in a cycle
will be much reduced.  In some extreme cases, when the link is long
and the cycle interval is set to extremely short, the first packet
sent in a cycle by a node will not be possibly received in the same
cycle interval at the next node.  That makes the useful time in a
cycle reaches zero in two buffer CQF.  Then two buffer CQF will be no
longer suitable.</t>

<t>In result of these considerations, reasonable limits for the size
of TSN CQF networks are in the order of at most few Km per hop,
beyond which DT exceeds common cycle times and possible through
of CQF traffic is hence 0.</t>

<section anchor="cqf-review"><name>Review of CQF benefits and challenges for DetNet</name>

<t>In review, CQF has a range of benefits for DetNet.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>It provides bounded latency.</t>
  <t>It provided tightly bounded jitter.</t>
  <t>It has a very simple and easily standardized calculus for its bounded latency and jitter.</t>
  <t>It has very simple per-hop forwarding machinery (cyclic queues) easily supportable in high-speed network equipment.</t>
  <t>Like Diffserv forwarding, it does not use per-hop,per-flow state in the forwarding plane and therefore does not require per-hop,per-flow signaling with the DetNet controller-plane, allowing it to scale to large number of flows.</t>
  <t>The faster the links are, the lower the per-hop latency impact of the cyclic queuing mechanism.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The core limitation of CQF, which TCQF intends to solve, lies in its use of arrival time clock to determine the cycle into which the packet is to be placed, see <xref target="I-D.eckert-detnet-bounded-latency-problems"/> for more details.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Cycles times should be as short as feasible to support lower end to end latency (<xref target="highspeed"/>).</t>
  <t>When networks have longer links, or links with higher propagation jitter as in Metro and WAN, this increases the dead time, and hence reduces the possible utilization or need to increase cycle times.</t>
  <t>When shorter cycle times are feasible because of higher speed links, this would require an increase in clock-synchronization accuracy.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="tagged-cqf"><name>Tagged CQF</name>

<t>Tagging of CQF packets with cycle identifiers can be used to solve
the dilemma aforementioned with minor changes to the fundamental two buffer CQF.
This section introduces this mechanism with multipl buffers and
CQF cycle identification in the packet header. Note that we are also now
using the term packet (as used for IP, MPLS and other IETF forwarding planes) and
buffers for packets, as opposed to frames as used by IEEE.</t>

<section anchor="cqf-with-more-than-two-buffers"><name>CQF with more than two buffers</name>

<t>CQF can use more than two buffers to minimize the dead time and
increase the useful time in a cycle so as to support long link delay.
<xref target="Fig3"/> shows how a three buffer CQF works in a rotating manner in
general.  Node A sends packets in cycle (i-1).  The time interval
over which node B receives these packet spans two cycles, cycle (i-1)
and cycle i.  Hence a method is needed to make node B send them all
at once in cycle (i+1) in order to ensure packets in a single cycle
from the previous node always being sent out in one cycle at the
current node.</t>

DT=Dead Time

<t>More than three buffers will be required when the receiving interval
at node B for packets sent in a single cycle interval from node A
spans over more than two cycle interval boundaries.  This can happen
when the time variance (jitter) including propagation, processing, regulation,
clock synchronization variance (so called Maximum Time Interval Error - MTIE)
and other factors between two neighbouring DetNet nodes can become larger
than a single cycle tim.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="from-cqf-with-multiple-buffers-to-tcqf"><name>From CQF with multiple buffers to TCQF</name>

<t>Note that due to the variance in time, the receiving interval at the
downstream node can be much larger than one cycle interval in which
the upstream node transmits.  When time variance is large and cycle
interval and dead time are set small, the possible receiving time of
the last few packets from node A’s cycle (i-1) at node B can overlap
with the possible receiving time of the first few packets from node
A’s cycle i in different rounds of buffer rotations.  Hence, when the
buffer number is larger than two, if the receiving side still uses
the traditional CQF implicit time borderline to demarcate the
receiving packets from the consecutive cycles of the upstream node,
it may cause the ambiguity in identifying the right sending cycle at
the upstream node and further affect the correctness of the decision
of which output buffer to put the received packets at the current
node.</t>

<t><xref target="Fig4"/> shows such an ambiguity when time based cycle demarcation is
used.  The packet sent by node A in its cycle (i-1) can be received
at any time in the receiving interval indicated as “receiving window
for A’s buf_1” in Figure 4.  The receiving window refers to the time
interval between the earliest time that the first packet sent in a
given cycle from an upstream node is processed and enqueued in an
output buffer and the latest time that the last packet of the cycle
is processed and enqueued in an output buffer.  Network operators may
configure the size of the receiving window, taking the time variance
of their networks into account.  It can be seen that the spanning
time period of receiving window is longer than the cycle interval.
This is because there is a large time variance experienced between A
and B, e.g. varying processing time for different packets in
different cycles.  It does not mean the receiving interval for every
cycle always constantly span over such a large receiving window.  The
receiving window time interval indeed is determined by the worst case
time variance value and that should be used for regular time cycle
demarcation.</t>

DT=Dead Time
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>When a packet is received in ambiguity window 1 in <xref target="Fig4"/>, node B
is not able to use the receiving time to determine which buffer is
the correct one to put the packet in because it cannot tell if the
packet is sent from cycle (i-1) or cycle i on node A.  If node B puts
the packet to the wrong output buffer, the packet may experience the
unexpected delay.  At the same time, the packet occupying the non-
designated buffer may break the contracts between the end hosts and
DetNet networks and then cause the unpredictable consequences.</t>

<t>It has been noted that the DT can be greatly increased to beat the
time variance in order to make the receiving windows do not overlap
so as to remove such ambiguity.  However, it is not always practical
and usually not desired because large DT will eat useful cycle time
and bring the low utilization issue as illustrated in <xref target="cqfdt"/>.
Therefore, it would be desired to keep DT as small as possible and at
the same time identify the cycle interval correctly.</t>

<t>With tagged CQF, the sending router A encodes the sending cycle identification in some
existing or new packet header field as specified later in this document.
This allows the receiving router B to determine the correct output port cycle buffer to
place the data packet into. Except for the need for the operator to
pre-configure this mapping on router B, based on the above described latency and jitter
of the link (and processing between the sending and receiving router,
tagging does not change the fundamental mechanism and benefits of CQF.
makes no change from the fundamental CQF.</t>

<t>Compared to CQF with multiple buffers, Tagged CQF allows to
operate with clock synchronization at significantly reduced accuracy
requirements than CQF. In CQF, the MTIE is an addend determing DT 
and should hence typically be less than 1% of the cycle time. In TCQF it
is an addent in the permitted receive window and can hence be for  example
as large as the cycle time, and such 100 times larger. A network using
TCQF with 100Gbps interfaces can hence can hence use the same or less
expensive clock synchronization setup than a CQF network with 1Gbps interfaces.
In addition, when conditions of the network connections change, the mappings
can dynamically changed from network operations.</t>

<t>CQF with multiple buffers but without tagging has been proposed to IEEE TSN
in <xref target="multipleCQF"/>, but has not been adopted. Instead of relying on a cycle
tag in a packet header, it still relies solely on the arrival time of packet,
and can hence not equally resolve arrival time ambiguities as TCQF can,
because it does not know the cycle from which the packet was sent.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="summary-of-tcqf-benefits-and-goals-for-detnet"><name>Summary of TCQF benefits and goals for DetNet</name>

<t>TCQF inherits the benefits of CQF for DetNet as outlined in <xref target="cqf-review"/>, and byusing a configurable number of three or more cycles, and signaling the cycle as part of a packet header, it resolves these problems as follows.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>With three cycles, TCQF can support arbitrary latency links at arbitrary speeds without reduction of utilization because of longer links or higher link speeds (same cycle time, same clock accuracy, only change in lengths and speeds).</t>
  <t>With four or more cycles, TCQF can also eliminate Dead Time caused by variation of clock synchronization inaccuracies (MTIE) as well as jitter caused by link propagation and processing variation. The sum of cycles times needs to be larger than the total jitter to achieve this.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Prior documents describing the concept of TCQF (without using that name) include <xref target="I-D.qiang-detnet-large-scale-detnet"/> and <xref target="I-D.dang-queuing-with-multiple-cyclic-buffers"/>. TCQF does not depend on other elements of <xref target="RFC8655"/>, so it can also be used stand alone in otherwise non-deterministic IP/IPv6 or MPLS networks to achieve bounded latency and low jitter.</t>

<t>TCQF is likely especially beneficial when networks are architected to avoid per-hop, per-flow state even for traffic steering, which is the case for networks using SR-MPLS <xref target="RFC8402"/> for traffic steering of MPLS unicast traffic, SRv6 <xref target="RFC8986"/> for traffic steeering of IPv6 unicast traffic and/or BIER-TE <xref target="I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch"/> for tree engineering of MPLS multicast traffic by using the TC and/or DSCP header fields of BIER packets according to <xref target="RFC8296"/>.</t>

<t>In these networks, it is specifically undesirable to require per-flow signaling to non-edge forwarders (such as P-LSR in MPLS networks) solely for DetNet QoS because such per-flow state is unnecessary for traffic steering and would only be required for the bounded latency QoS mechanism and require likely even more complex hardware and manageability support than what was previously required for per-hop steering state (such as in RSVP-TE, <xref target="RFC4875"/>). Note that the DetNet architecture <xref target="RFC8655"/> does not include full support for this DiffServ model, which is why this memo describes how to use TCQF with the DetNet architecture per-hop, per-flow processing as well as without it.</t>

<t>The above <xref target="FIG-DetNet-MPLS"/>, is copied from <xref target="RFC8964"/>, Figure 2, 
and only enhanced by numbering the nodes to be able to better refer
to them in the following text.</t>

<t>Assume a DetNet flow is sent from T-PE1 to T-PE2 across S-PE1, LSR, S-PE2. 
In general, bounded latency QoS processing is then required on the
outgoing interface of T-PE1 towards S-PE1, and any further outgoing
interface along the path. When T-PE1 and S-PE2 know that their next-hop
is a service LSR, their DetNet flow label stack may simply have the
DetNet flows Service Label (S-Label) as its Top of Stack (ToS) LSE,
explicitly indicating one DetNet flow.</t>

<t>On S-PE1, the next-hop LSR is
not DetNet aware, which is why S-PE1 would need to send a label stack
where the S-Label is followed by a Forwarding Label (F-Label), and
LSR-P would need to perform bounded latency based QoS on that F-Label.</t>

<t>For bounded latency QoS mechanisms relying on per-flow regulator state (aka:
per-flow packet scheduling), such as in <xref target="TSN-ATS"/>, this requires the use of a
per-detnet flow F-Labels across the network from S-PE1 to S-PE2. These could
for for example be assigned/managed through RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209"/>
enhanced as necessary with QoS parameters matching the underlying bounded
latency mechanism (such as <xref target="TSN-ATS"/>).</t>

<t>With TCQF, a sequence of LSR and DetNet service node implements
TCQF with MPLS TC, ideally from T-PE1 (ingress) to T-PE2 (egress).  The ingress
node needs to perform per-DetNet-flow per-packet "shaping"/"regulating" to  assign
each packet of a flow to a particular TCQF cycle. This is specified in <xref target="ingress"/>.</t>

<t>All LSR/Service nodes after the ingress node only have to map a
received TCQF tagged DetNet packet to the configured cycle
on the output interface, not requiring any per-DetNet-flow QoS state.
These LSR/Service nodes do therefore also not require per-flow
interactions with the controller plane for the purpose of bounded latency.</t>

<t>Per-flow state therefore is only required on nodes that are 
DetNet service nodes, or when explicit, per-DetNet flow steering
state is desired, instead of ingress steering through e.g.: SR-MPLS.</t>

<t>Operating TCQF per-flow stateless across a service node, such as S-PE1, S-PE2
in the picture is only one option. It is of course equally feasible to
Have one TCQF domain from T-PE1 to S-PE2, start a new TCQF domain there,
running for example up to S-PE2 and start another one to T-PE2.</t>

<t>A service node must act as an egress/ingress edge of a TCQF domain if it needs
to perform operations that do change the timing of packets other than
the type of latency that can be considered in configuration of TCQF (see <xref target="calculation"></xref>).</t>

<t>For example, if T-PE1 is ingress for a TCQF domain, and T-PE2 is the egress,
S-PE1 could perform the DetNet Packet Replication Function (PRF)  without having to be a TQCF 
edge node as long as it does not introduce latencies not included in the TCQF
setup and the controller plane reserves resources for the multitude of flows
created by the replication taking the allocation of resources in the TCQF cycles into account.</t>

<t>Likewise, S-PE2 could perform the Packet Elimination Function without being
a TCQF edge node as this most likely does not introduce any non-TCQF acceptable
latency - and the controller plane accordingly reserves only for one flow
the resources on the S-PE2-&gt;T-PE2 leg.</t>

<t>If on the other hand, S-PE2 was to perform the Packet Reordering Function (PRF), this could
create large peaks of packets when out-of-order packets are released together.
A PRF would either have to take care of shaping out those bursts for the traffic
of a flow to again conform to the admitted CIR/PIR, or else the service node
would have to be a TCQF egress/ingress, performing that shaping itself as an
ingress function.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="processing"><name>Packet processing</name>

<t>This section explains the TCQF packet processing and through
it, introduces the semantic of the objects in <xref target="FIG-Data-Model"/></t>

<t>tcqf contains the router wide configuration of TCQF parameters,
independent of the specific tagging mechanism on any interface. Any
interface can have a different tagging method. This document uses the term
router when it is irrelevant whether forwarding is for IP or MPLS packet,
and the term Label Switched Router (LSR) to indicate MPLS is used, or IP
router to indicate IP or IPv6 are used - independent of the specific encapsulation
used for IP or MPLS to carry the cycle identification.</t>

<t>The model represents a single TQCF domain, which is a set of
interfaces acting both as ingress (iif) and egress (oif)
interfaces, capable to forward TCQF packets amongst each other. A router
may have multiple TCQF domains each with a set of interfaces disjoint
from those of any other TCQF domain.</t>

<t>tcqf.cycles is the number of cycles used across all interfaces in the TCQF domain.
routers MUST support 3 and 4 cycles. The maximum number of supportable cycles
depends on the encapsulation. For example, to support interfaces with MPLS TC tagging,
7 or fewer cycles MUST be used across all interfaces in the CQF domain. See <xref target="mpls"/>.</t>

<t>The unit of tcqf.cycle_time is micro-seconds.
routers MUST support configuration of cycle-times of 20,50,100,200,500,1000,2000 usec.</t>

<t>Cycles start at an offset of tcqf.cycle_clock_offset in units of nsec as follows. 
Let clock1 be a timestamp of the local reference clock for TCQF, at which
cycle 1 starts, then:</t>

<t>tcqf.cycle_clock_offset = (clock1 mod (tcqf.cycle_time * tcqf.cycles) )</t>

<t>The local reference clock of the router is expected to be synchronized with
the neighboring LSR/router in TCQF domain.  tcqf.cycle_clock_offset can be configurable
by the operator, or it can be read-only. In either case will the operator be
able to configure working TCQF forwarding through appropriately calculated
cycle mapping.</t>

<t>tcqf.if_config[oif] is optional per-interface configuration of TCQF parameters.
tcqf.if_config[oif].cycle_clock_offset may be different from tcqf.cycle_clock_offset,
for example, when interfaces are on line cards with independently synchronized clocks,
or when non-uniform ingress-to-egress propagation latency over a complex router/LSR
fabric makes it beneficial to allow per-egress interface or line card configuration
of cycle_clock_offset. It may be configurable or read-only.</t>

<t>The value of -1 for tcqf.if_config[oif].cycle_clock_offset is used to indicate
that the domain wide tcqf.cycle_clock_offset is to be used for oif.
This is the only permitted negative number for this parameter.</t>

<t>When a packet is received from iif with a cycle value of iif_cycle and the
packet is routed towards oif, then the cycle value (and buffer) to use on
oif is tcqf.if_config[oif].cycle_map[iif].oif_cycle[iif_cycle]. This is
called the cycle mapping and is must be configurable. This cycle mapping
always happens when the packet is received with a cycle tag on an interface
in a TCQF domain and forwarded to another interface in the same TCQF domain.</t>

<t>This encapsulation independent data model only defines how to map from
a received packets cycle to a sending interface cycle buffer and hence sent
packet cycle. It does not specify how the cycle identifier is encoded in
the received or sent packet. This is amended by the specification in the following
sections.</t>

<t>This data model does therefore also not determine whether interfaces use IP/IPv6, MPLS
or any other encapsulation. This is determined by the configuration of the DetNet domain. A mixed
use of MPLS and IP/IPv6 interfaces is possible with this data model, but
at the time of writing this document not supported by DetNet.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="mpls"><name>TCQF for MPLS with TC tagging</name>

<t>This section describes operation of TCQF for MPLS packets using the
Traffic Class (TC) field of MPLS label to carry the cycle-id. To support
this encapsulation, the TCQF Data Model as defined in <xref target="FIG-Data-Model"/>
is expanded as follows.</t>

<figure title="TCQF Configuration Data for MPLS TC" anchor="FIG-Data-Model-TC"><artwork><![CDATA[
# MPLS TC tagging specific data
tcqf_tc[oif]
+--uint8 tc[oif_cycle]
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>tcqf_tc[oif].tc[oif_cycle] defines how to map from the internal cycle number
oif_cycle to an MPLS TC value on interface oif. tcqf_tc[oif] MUST be
configured, when oif uses MPLS. This oif_cycle &lt;=&gt; tc mapping is not only
 used to map from internal cycle number to MPLS TC tag when sending
packets, but also to map from MPLS TC tag to the internal cycle number when
receiving packets.</t>

<t>In the terminology of <xref target="RFC3270"/>, TCQF QoS as defined here, is 
TC-Inferred-PSC LSP (E-LSP) behavior: Packets are determined to
belong to the TCQF PSC solely based on the TC of the received
packet.</t>

<t>The internal cycle number SHOULD be assigned from the Top of Stack (ToS)
MPLS label TC bits before any other label stack operations
happens. On the egress side, the TC value of the ToS MPLS label
SHOULD be assigned from the internal cycle number after any label
stack processing.</t>

<t>With this order of processing, TCQF can support forwarding of
packets with any label stack operations such as label swap in the
case of LDP or RSVP-TE created LSP, Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP),
or no label changes from SID hop-by-hop forwarding and/or SID/label
pop as in the case of SR-MPLS traffic steering.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="dscp"><name>TCQF for IP/IPv6 with DSCP tagging</name>

<t>This section describes operation of TCQF for IP/IPv6 packets using the
Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field of IP/IPv6 packets to carry the cycle-id.
To support this encapsulation, the TCQF Data Model as defined in <xref target="FIG-Data-Model"/>
is expanded as follows.</t>

<figure title="TCQF Configuration Data for IP/IPv6 DSCP" anchor="FIG-Data-Model-DSCP"><artwork><![CDATA[
# IP/IPv6 DSCP tagging specific data
tcqf_dscp[oif]
+--uint8 dscp[oif_cycle]
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>tcqf_dscp[oif].dscp[oif_cycle] defines how to map from the internal cycle number
oif_cycle to an IP/IPv6 DSCP value on interface oif. tcqf_dscp[oif] MUST be
configured, when oif uses DSCP tagging of IP/IPv6 packets for TCQF. This
oif_cycle &lt;=&gt; idscp mapping is not only used to map from internal cycle number to the
DSCP tag when sending packets, but also to map from IP/IPv6 DSCP to the internal cycle number when
receiving packets.</t>

<t>As how DetNet domains are currently assumed to be single administrative network
operator domains, this document does not ask for standardization
of the DSCP to use with TCQF. Instead, deployments wanting to use TCQF with
IP/IPv6 encapsulation and DSCP tagging need to assign within their domain DSCP from the
xxxx11 "EXP/LU" Codepoint space according to <xref target="RFC2474"/>, Section 6. This
allows up to 16 DSCP for intradomain use and hence up to 16 cycle identifiers.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="option"><name>TCQF for IPv6 with IPv6 Option tagging</name>

<t>This section describes operation of TCQF for IPv6 packets without having
to rely on DSCP by defining a new IPv6 option for DetNet.  This option is to be placed in the
IPv6 HbH (Hop-by-Hop) Options or DOH (Destination Option Header) header.
To support this encapsulation, the TCQF Data Model as defined in <xref target="FIG-Data-Model"/>
is expanded as follows.</t>

the fundamental cyclic queuing and forwarding behaviors of TCQF over

<t>Compared to DSCP it does not introduce a limited number of cycle-ids, and
eliminates the possible operation consideration to use multiple DSCP for

<t><xref target="Fig6"/> shows the encapsulation of TCQF option in HbH
extension header for deterministic IP (DIP）data plane.  When every DetNet forwarding node along the path
is provisioned to use TCQF as the queuing mechanism, this
option should be placed here.  If a router does not support this
option, it discards the packet and returns an ICMP message.</t>

<t>In some deployments the path selection is indicated using IPv6
routing header (RH) by specifying a set of nodes that must be
traversed by the packet along its path to the destination.  When such
a source routing mechanism is used, TCQF Option is placed in
DOH (Destination Option Header) as shown in <xref target="Fig7"/> for Deterministic IP data plane. Then the TCQF
Option will be processed by the specified in-path routers.</t>

<t>Processing of ingress TCQF packets is performed
via ingres_flow_enqueue(pak) and
ingress_flow_2_tcqf(oif,cycle) as explained in <xref target="ingres_pseudocode"/>.</t>

<t>Packets in a cycle buffer can be sent almost arbitrarily within the time
period of the cycle. They also do not need to be sent as soon as possible,
as long as all will be sent within that period. There is no need to send them
in the order of their arrival except that packets from the same ingres
flow that end up in the same cycle must not be reordered across any number of
tcqf hops. The pseudocode describes this by using a queue oif.cycleq[cycle,iif] ([3]) for
all packets from the same iif. The pseudocode describes the oterwise
arbitrary scheduling of all packets within the cycle time via the
statement shown in [4].</t>

<t>Ingress packets are passed from their ingress queues to the next cycle queue via [5].</t>

<t>Processing of egres TCQF packets is out-of-scope. 
It can performed by any non-TCQF packet forwarding mechanism such as
some strict priority queuing in step [2], and packets could accordingly be
marked with an according packet header traffic class indicator for
such a traffic class in step [1].</t>

<section anchor="ingress"><name>TCQF Per-flow Ingress forwarding (normative)</name>

<t>Ingress flows in the context of this text
are packets of flows that enter the router from a non-TCQF interface
and need to be forwarded to an interface with TCQF.</t>

<t>In the most simple case, these packets are sent by the
source and the router is the first-hop router.
In another case, the routers ingress interface
connects to a hop where the previous router(s) did
perform a different bounded latency forwarding mechanism
than TCQF.</t>

<t>The data model shown in <xref target="FIG-IData-Model"/> expands the tcqf data
model  from <xref target="FIG-Data-Model"/>. For every DetNet flow for which
this router is the TCQF ingress, the controller plane has to specify a maximum 
number of bits called csize (cycle size) that are permitted to 
go into each individual cycle.</t>

<t>Note, that iflow[flowid].csize is not specific to the sending
interface because it is a property of the DetNet flow.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ingres_pseudocode"><name>Ingress Flows Pseudocode</name>

<t>When a TCQF ingress is received, it first has to be enqueued into a
per-flow queue. This is necessary because the permitted
burst size for the flow may be larger than what can fit
into a single cycle, or even into the number of cycles
used in the network.</t>

<t>police(pak): If the router is not only the TCQF ingress router, but also
the first-hop router from the source, ingres_flow_enqueue(pak)

according to the Traffic Specification of the flow would happen -
to ensure that packets violating the Traffic Specification
will not be forwarded, or be forwarded with lower priority
(e.g.: as best effort). This policing and resulting forwarding
action is not specific to TCQF and therefore out of scope for

<section anchor="solution-scope"><name>Solution scope</name>

<t>TCQF is proposed as a solution not standalone, but in conjunction with <xref target="I-D.eckert-detnet-flow-interleaving"/>
as a per-flow mechanism to be used on the ingress TCQF router to allow more flexible per-flow management
of admission of flow bursts into cycles than presented in this document. The reason for splitting up
the proposal into two documents is because <xref target="I-D.eckert-detnet-flow-interleaving"/> can be combined
with all "mostly-synchronous" per-hop mechanisms, for example beyong TCQF also (of course) CQF and
GLBF (<xref target="I-D.eckert-detnet-glbf"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="taxonomy"><name>Taxonomy</name>

<t>Using the section number/titles of the taxonomy document
<xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-dataplane-taxonomy"/> the TCQF technology
can be classified as follows.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>4.1 Per Hop Dominant Factor for Latency Bound  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The per-hop dominan latency bound is Category 3. The per-hop latency for each
class is determined by the cycle size, which has to be determined by the
sum of burst sizes required by the flows. This burst can be split up across
multiple cycles by the mechanisms described in <xref target="I-D.eckert-detnet-flow-interleaving"/>
for flows whose rate is low enough that they do not need resources in every cycle.</t>
  <t>5.1 Periodicity  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
TCQF is Periodic, however, by using tagging it reduces the required synchronization
across the network (using CQF as a reference) by potentially a factor of 100 or
more, allowing to use the same or even less stringent clock synchronization at 100 times
or more speedup versus current CQF networks.</t>
  <t>5.2.  Traffic Granularity  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
TCQF has Class level granularity. In its current form, this draft only describes operation
for a single cycle class, but it can easily be extended to use multiple classes. In addition,
additional differentiation into more classes can happen at the ingress edge through
<xref target="I-D.eckert-detnet-flow-interleaving"/>. However, those additional options do not increase
the amount of per-hop state in the TCQF network, that will stay limited to the cycle states
required for the per-hop classes (e.g.: just one class now). Hence TCQF maintains minimal
state per-hop.</t>
  <t>5.3.  Time Bounds  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
TCQF is Bounded (Left and Right bounded) as determind by the time in which the cycle the packet is
in is sent. In result, The total end-to-end jitter of a packet is limited to the 
cycle time deployed, as is the per-hop jitter.</t>
  <t>5.4 Service Order  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
TCQF service order is solely arrival based.</t>
  <t><list style="numbers">
      <t>Suitable Categories for DetNet</t>

TCQF is "6.3.  Class level periodic bounded category" according to the categorization.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="status"><name>Status</name>

<t>TCQF has a high-speed (100Gbps interface) ASIC/FPGA implementation which was deployed and
tested by an academic network test organization, a test report is in <xref target="CENI"/>. There is
also a large-scale simulation of the algorithm/mechanisms and results presented at a
peer reviewed academic conference, see <xref target="LDN"/>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="high-speed-implementation"><name>High-Speed Implementation</name>

<t>High-speed implementations with programmable forwarding planes of TCQF
packet forwarding require Time-Gated Queues for the cycle queues,
such as introduced by <xref target="IEEE802.1Qbv"/> and also employed in CQF <xref target="IEEE802.1Qch"/>.</t>

<t>Compared to CQF, the accuracy of clock synchronization across the nodes
is reduced as explained in <xref target="calculation"/> below.</t>

<t>High-speed forwarding for ingress packets as specified in <xref target="ingress"/>
above would require to pass packets first into a per-flow queue and
then re-queue them into a cycle queue. This is not ideal for
high speed implementations.  The pseudocode for ingres_flow_enqueue()
and ingress_flow_2_tcqf(), like the rest of the pseudocode in this
document is only meant to serve as the most compact and hopefully
most easy to read specification of the desired externally observable
behavior of TCQF - but not as a guidance for implementation, especially not
for high-speed forwarding planes.</t>

<t>High-speed forward could be implemented with single-enqueueing into
cycle queues as follows:</t>

<t>Let B[f] be the maximum amount of data that the router would need to
buffer for ingress flow f at any point in time. This can be calculated
from the flows Traffic Specification. For example, when using the
parameters of <xref target="RFC9016"/>, section 5.5.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
B[f] <= MaxPacketsPerInterval*MaxPayloadSize*8

maxcycles = max( ceil( B[f] / tcqf.iflow[f].csize) | f)
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Maxcycles is the maximum number of cycles required so that packets
from all ingress flows can be directly enqueued into maxcycles queues.
The router would then not cycle across tcqf.cycles number of queues,
but across maxcycles number of queues, but still cycling across tcqf.cycles
number of cycle tags.</t>

<t>Calculation of B[f] and in result maxcycles may further be refined (lowered)
by additionally known constraints such as the bitrates of the ingress interface(s)
and TCQF output interface(s).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="calculation"><name>Controller plane computation of cycle mappings</name>

<t>The cycle mapping is computed by the controller plane by taking at minimum
the link, interface serialization and node internal forwarding latencies as well
as the cycle_clock_offsets into account.</t>

<figure title="Calculation reference" anchor="Calc1"><artwork><![CDATA[

CC  = CT * C
O1  = cycle_clock_offset router R1, interface towards R2
O2  = cycle_clock_offset router R2, output interface of interest
O1' = O1 + D
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Consider in <xref target="Calc1"/> that Router R1 sends packets via C = 3 cycles with a
cycle_clock offset of O1 towards Router R2. These packets arrive
at R2 with a cycle_clock offset of O1' which includes through D all latencies
incurred between releasing a packet on R1 from the cycle buffer until
it can be put into a cycle buffer on R2: serialization delay on R1,
link delay, non_CQF delays in R1 and R2, especially forwarding in
R2, potentially across an internal fabric to the output interface
with the sending cycle buffers.</t>

<figure title="Calculating cycle mapping" anchor="Calc2"><artwork><![CDATA[
A = ( ceil( ( O1' - O2 ) / CT) + C + 1) mod CC
map(i) = (i - 1 + A) mod C + 1
]]></artwork></figure>

<t><xref target="Calc2"/> shows a formula to calculate the cycle mapping between
R1 and R2, using the first available cycle on R2. In the example
of <xref target="Calc1"/> with CT = 1, (O1' - O2) =~ 1.8, A will be 0, resulting
in map(1) to be 1, map(2) to be 2 and map(3) to be 3.</t>

<t>The offset "C" for the calculation of A is included so that
a negative (O1 - O2) will still lead to a positive A.</t>

<t>In general, D will be variable [Dmin...Dmax], for example because
of differences in serialization latency between min and max size
packets, variable link latency because of temperature based length
variations, link-layer variability (radio links) or in-router
processing variability. In addition, D also needs to account for the
drift between the synchronized clocks for R1 and R2. This
is called the Maximum Time Interval Error (MTIE).</t>

<t>Let A(d) be A where O1' is calculated with D = d. To account for
the variability of latency and clock synchronization, map(i) has to
be calculated with A(Dmax), and the controller plane needs to
ensure that that A(Dmin)...A(Dmax) does cover at most (C - 1) cycles.</t>

<t>If it does cover C cycles, then C and/or CT are chosen too small,
and the controller plane needs to use larger numbers for either.</t>

<t>This (C - 1) limitation is based on the understanding that there is only
one buffer for each cycle, so a cycle cannot receive packets
when it is sending packets. While this could be changed by
using double buffers, this would create additional implementation
complexity and not solve the limitation for all cases, because
the number of cycles to cover [Dmin...Dmax] could also be (C + 1)
or larger, in which case a tag of 1...C would not suffice.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="link-speed-and-bandwidth-sharing"><name>Link speed and bandwidth sharing</name>

<t>TCQF hops along a path do not need to have the same bitrate, they
just need to use the same cycle time. The controller plane has to then
be able to take the TCQF capacity of each hop into account when
admitting flows based on their Traffic Specification and TCQF csize.</t>

<t>TCQF does not require to be allocated 100% of the
link bitrate. When TCQF has to share a link with other traffic
classes, queuing just has to be set up to ensure that all
data of a TCQF cycle buffer can be sent within the TCQF
cycle time. For example by making the TCQF cycle queues the
highest priority queues and then limiting their capacity through
admission control to leave time for other queues to be served
as well.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="controller-plane-considerations"><name>Controller-plane considerations</name>

<t>TCQF is applicable to both centralized as well as decentralized/distributed
controller-plane models. From the perspective of the controller plane. If
the controller-plane is centralized, then it is logically very simple to
perform admission control for any additional flow by checking that there
is sufficient bandwidth for the amount of bits required for the flow on
every cycle along the intended path. Likewise, path computation can be
done to determine on which non-shortest path those resources are available.</t>

<t>More efficient use of resources can be achieved by considering that flows
with low bit rates would not need bits reserved in every cycle, but only in
every N'th cyce. This requires different gates on ingres to admit packets
from such flows than shown in this document and more complex admission control
that attempts for example to interleave multiple flows across different
set of cycles to as best as possible utilize all cycles. This is the same
complexity as possible in TSN technologies. Beside the admission control
and different ingres policing, such enhancements have no impact on the
per-hop TCQF forwarding and can thus potentially be added incrementally.</t>

<t>Decentralized or distributed controller planes including on-path, per-flow
signaling, such as one using the mechanisms of RSVP-TE, <xref target="RFC3209"/> is
equally feasible with TCQF. In this case one of the potential benefits of TCQ is not
leveraged, which is the complete removal of per-hop,per-flow awarenes on
each router. Nevertheless, the controller-plane only introduces the need
for this state maintenance into the control-plane of each router, but
does not change the TCQF forwarding plane, but maintains its per-hop, per-flow
non-stateful nature and resulting performance/cost benefits.</t>

<t>Changed Data Model to "Configuration Data Model",</t>

<t>and changed syntax from YANG tree to a non-YANG tree, removed empty section
targeted for YANG model. Reason: the configuration parameters that we need
to specify the forwarding behavior is only a subset of what likely would
be a good YANG model, and any work to define such a YANG model not necessary
to specify the algorithm would be scope creep for this specification. Better
done in a separate YANG document. 
Example additional YANG aspects for such a document are
how to map parameters to configuration/operational space, what additional
operational/monitoring parameter to support and how to map the
YANG objects required into various pre-existing YANG trees.</t>

<t>Improved text in forwarding section, simplified sentences, used simplified

<t>Added text for DSCP based tagging of IP/IPv6 packets, therefore changing the
original, MPLS-only centric scope of the document, necessitating a change
in name and title.</t>

<t>This was triggered by the observation of David Black at the IETF114 DetNet
meeting that with DetNet domains being single administrative domains, it
is not necessary to have standardized (cross administrative domain) DSCP
for the tagging of IP/IP6 packets for TCQF. Instead it is sufficient
to use EXP/LU DSCP code space and assignment of these is a local matter
of a domain as is that of TC values when MPLS is used. Standardized DSCP
in the other hand would have required likely work/oversight by TSVWG.</t>

<t>In any case, the authors feel that with this insight, there is no need to
constrain single-domain definition of TCQF to only MPLS, but instead both
MPLS and IP/IPv6 tagging can be easily specified in this one draft.</t>

      <t>This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency within a network domain. Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the network topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in spite of the loss of a path. DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time- Sensitive Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1.</t>

	 <t>   This memo explain requirements, benefits and feasibility of a new
   DetNet service function tentatively called &quot;flow interleaving&quot;.  It
   proposes to introduce this service function into the DetNet
   architecture.

   Flow interleaving can be understood as a DetNet equivalent of the
   IEEE TSN timed gates.  Its primary role is intended to be at the
   ingress edge of DetNet domains supporting higher utilization and
   lower bounded latency for flow aggregation (interleaving of flows
   into a single flow), as well as higher utilization and lower bounded
   latency for interleaving occurring in transit hops of the DetNet
   domain in conjunction with in-time per-hop bounded latency forwarding
   mechanisms.

    <abstract>
      <t>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a "multicast domain", without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any per-flow state or to engage in an explicit tree-building protocol. When a multicast data packet enters the domain, the ingress router determines the set of egress routers to which the packet needs to be sent. The ingress router then encapsulates the packet in a BIER header. The BIER header contains a bit string in which each bit represents exactly one egress router in the domain; to forward the packet to a given set of egress routers, the bits corresponding to those routers are set in the BIER header. The details of the encapsulation depend on the type of network used to realize the multicast domain. This document specifies a BIER encapsulation that can be used in an MPLS network or, with slight differences, in a non-MPLS network.</t>

      <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called "segments". A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service based. A segment can have a semantic local to an SR node or global within an SR domain. SR provides a mechanism that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological path, while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SR domain.</t>
      <t>SR can be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change to the forwarding plane. A segment is encoded as an MPLS label. An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels. The segment to process is on the top of the stack. Upon completion of a segment, the related label is popped from the stack.</t>
      <t>SR can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header. A segment is encoded as an IPv6 address. An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing header. The active segment is indicated by the Destination Address (DA) of the packet. The next active segment is indicated by a pointer in the new routing header.</t>

	 <t>This memo describes per-packet stateless strict and loose path steered replication and forwarding for &quot;Bit Index Explicit Replication&quot; (BIER) packets (RFC 8279); it is called &quot;Tree Engineering for Bit Index Explicit Replication&quot; (BIER-TE) and is intended to be used as the path steering mechanism for Traffic Engineering with BIER.

 BIER-TE introduces a new semantic for &quot;bit positions&quot; (BPs). These BPs indicate adjacencies of the network topology, as opposed to (non-TE) BIER in which BPs indicate &quot;Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers&quot; (BFERs). A BIER-TE &quot;packets BitString&quot; therefore indicates the edges of the (loop-free) tree across which the packets are forwarded by BIER-TE. BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little changes. Co-existence of BIER and BIER-TE forwarding in the same domain is possible -- for example, by using separate BIER &quot;subdomains&quot; (SDs). Except for the optional routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing underlay and can therefore operate without depending on a routing protocol such as the &quot;Interior Gateway Protocol&quot; (IGP).

      <abstract>
	 <t>   The purpose of this memo is to explain the challenges and limitations
   of existing (standardized) bounded latency queuing mechanisms for
   desirable (large scale) MPLS and/or IP based networks to allow them
   to support DetNet services.  These challenges relate to low-cost,
   high-speed hardware implementations, desirable network design
   approaches, system complexity, reliability, scalability, cost of
   signaling, performance and jitter experience for the DetNet
   applications.  Many of these problems are rooted in the use of per-
   hop, per-flow (DetNet) forwarding and queuing state, but highly
   accurate network wide time synchronization can be another challenge
   for some networks.

   This memo does not intend to propose a specific queuing solution, but
   in the same way in which it describes the challenges of mechanisms,
   it reviews how those problem are addressed by currently proposed new
   queuing mechanisms.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   One of the goals of DetNet is to provide bounded end-to-end latency
   for critical flows.  This document defines how to leverage Segment
   Routing (SR) to implement bounded latency.  Specifically, the SR
   Identifier (SID) is used to specify transmission time (cycles) of a
   packet.  When forwarding devices along the path follow the
   instructions carried in the packet, the bounded latency is achieved.
   This is called Cycle Specified Queuing and Forwarding (CSQF) in this
   document.

   Since SR is a source routing technology, no per-flow state is
   maintained at intermediate and egress nodes, SR-based CSQF naturally
   supports flow aggregation that is deemed to be a key capability to
   allow DetNet to scale to large networks.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This memo proposes a mechanism called &quot;guaranteed Latency Based
   Forwarding&quot; (gLBF) as part of DetNet for hop-by-hop packet forwarding
   with per-hop deterministically bounded latency and minimal jitter.

   gLBF is intended to be useful across a wide range of networks and
   applications with need for high-precision deterministic networking
   services, including in-car networks or networks used for industrial
   automation across on factory floors, all the way to ++100Gbps
   country-wide networks.

   Contrary to other mechanisms, gLBF does not require network wide
   clock synchronization, nor does it need to maintain per-flow state at
   network nodes, avoiding drawbacks of other known methods while
   leveraging their advantages.

   Specifically, gLBF uses the queuing model and calculus of Urgency
   Based Scheduling (UBS, [UBS]), which is used by TSN Asynchronous
   Traffic Shaping [TSN-ATS]. gLBF is intended to be a plug-in
   replacement for TSN-ATN or as a parallel mechanism beside TSN-ATS
   because it allows to keeping the same controller-plane design which
   is selecting paths for TSN-ATS, sizing TSN-ATS queues, calculating
   latencies and admitting flows to calculated paths for calculated
   latencies.

   In addition to reducing the jitter compared to TSN-ATS by additional
   buffering (dampening) in the network, gLBF also eliminates the need
   for per-flow, per-hop state maintenance required by TSN-ATS.  This
   avoids the need to signal per-flow state to every hop from the
   controller-plane and associated scaling problems.  It also reduces
   implementation cost for high-speed networking hardware due to the
   avoidance of additional high-speed speed read/write memory access to
   retrieve, process and update per-flow state variables for a large
   number of flows.

<section anchor="csqf"><name>CSQF</name>

<t><xref target="I-D.chen-detnet-sr-based-bounded-latency"/> (CSQF) describes a variation of the cyclic
queuing mechanism in which the cycle identifier is not mapped by a mapping table
in each node (as in TCQF), instead the packet header carries the sequence of cycles for every
cyclic queuing hop. In the draft, this is proposed specifically for networks
using Segment Routing and can therefore allocate for N cycles N SIDs, each one for
a different cycle to allow indicating in a SID sequence header for each hop, which
cycle to use.</t>

<t>The core new functionality enabled with eliminating the cycle mapping table on
the routers and moving the sequence of cycles into the header is the ability to
utilize in a flexible fashion more than a fixed number of cycles, independently on each hop.</t>

<t>Assume a minimum of N (e.g.: N = 3) cycles would be required in a particular deployment
with TCQF. If CSQF is then set up with e.g.: N + 4 = 7 cycles, then it would be
possible for the controller-plane to delay packets of a flow on every hop
by 1,2,3 or 4 more cycles than necessary at minimum. This can lead to an easier
ability to achieve higher utilization in the face of controller-plane operations
that manages large number of flows in large scale DetNets, and does not allocate
to every flow bandwidth in every cycle. This naturally leads to uneven utilization
of cycles and the problem of managing distribution of traffic load across cycles.</t>

<t><xref target="I-D.eckert-detnet-flow-interleaving"/> discusses this overall advanced controller-plane
traffic management and how different queuing options can be used in such a setup. It
also describes the necessary ingress processing to allow forwarding traffic flows
only in such well engineered specific cycles.</t>

<t>While such advanced cycle engineering may look at first quite complex, it should simply
be compared to the mechanisms that already are standard in service provider networks
to manage bandwidth/capacity by engineering per-flow paths across topologies with
non-equal cost paths. In that overall complex problem space, managing distribution
of traffic across cycles is but a minor extension.</t>

<t>Note that TCQF can of course also benefit from such advanced cycle engineering at
the controller plane, albeit less flexibly than CSQF.</t>

<t>Given how CQSF and TCQF share all the forwarding behavior except for where the
cycle Identifier is retrieved from and how it is mapped, it would also be a very
useeful consideration to consider both approaches options of a single target standard.
It seems unlikely though, that an implementation that can support TCQF could not
support CSQF - or vice versa.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="priorities"><name>TCQF with multiple priorities</name>

<t>TSN CQF <xref target="IEEE802.1Qch"/> does permit to establish multiple independent cyclic
queuing instances and therefore create more flexbility.</t>

<t>Consider likewise, that in DetNet,
there are separate packet headers for a packet priority and a cycle identifier.
For each priority, a separate instance of TCQF is established, and the priority
decides which instance of CQF the packet gets processed by, whereas the cycle 
identifier determines the cycle within the TCQF instance.</t>

<t>Consider for example a setup with 4 priorities 1..4. The cycle time for the
highest priority 1 is C. The cycle time for priority 2 is 2 * C, for priority 3
3 * C and for priority 4 4 * C. In queuing, strict priority queuing is used,
packets from a priority 1 cycle queue will always be sent over those from
priorities 2...4, and so on. In result, a flow can now be given one out of
4 priorities, each with an increasing per-hop latency: C (prio 1), 2C (prio 2), 
3C (prio 3), 4C (prio 4). This does of course also require for admission control
to not allow full utilization of the capacity of cycles in each class. In a simple
static splitting of capacity across classes, each cycle of of each priority could for
example be allowed to be utilized up to 25%.</t>

<t>This multi-priority "extension" to TCQF is in this version of the document only
mentioned as an appendix, because it is not clear if this degree of flexibility is
desired in a first-generation target standard for TCQF. Given how both priority and
cycle identifiers are needed, this mechanism would certainly require for both MPLS
and IP/IPv6 a new extension header, such as the one proposed in this document
to carry the Cycle IDentifierm and then the priority could be indicated by the IP
header DSCP.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="tsn-multiple-buffer-cqf"><name>TSN Multiple Buffer CQF</name>

<t>CQF with multiple buffers but without tagging has been proposed to IEEE TSN
in <xref target="multipleCQF"/>, but has not been adopted. Instead of relying on a cycle
tag in a packet header as proposed in this memo, it still relies solely on
the arrival time of packet, and can hence not equally resolve arrival time
ambiguities as TCQF can, because it does not know the cycle from which the packet was sent,
or the cycle for which it is intended.</t>

<t>Consider that multiple buffer CQF is like TCQF, except the cycle id is
missing from the packet that is sent. Upon arrival at the receiving router,
the sending cycle ID has to be determined solely by the time the packet
is received (reception timestamp) because this time is an indicator of the
sending timestamp and hence the sending cycle. The sum of MTIE, processing
variation link propagation latency and other variations from layer 1 and layer
2 processing (forward error correction, retransmissions) is the erorr of
the sending time that the receiving router can determine. As soon as this
error is so large, that the receiving router can not unambiguously determine
a sending cycle, the mechanism does not work anymore. The receiving router can
also not simply assume for a packet to be sent by one of the possible cycles,
because when this is not the actual sending cycle, then such an assumption will
cause possible overruns of cycle buffers and hence failure of admission control
and pckets drop or congestion. In result, multiple buffer CQF without carrying
a target cycle in a packet header seems not feasible to actually solve the
issue or real propagation latency variation in transmission, or the perceived
variation in propagation due to jitter in clocks between adjacend nodes.</t>
